# ↪ Turning effects of forces

## Turning effects of forces

* **The turning effect of a force is called the moment of a force or torque**
* Turning a door knob, turning on a tap, pushing on a door to swing it open and using a bottle cap opener are some examples of the turning effects of forces
* **The moment of the force is defined as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force**
* Formula: $$Moment = F \times D$$​, where Moment is the moment of the force (newton meter, N m), F is the force (Newtons, N) and D is the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force (meters, m)
* The smaller the distance, the larger the force to produce the same moment
* Moments are vectors, they have both magnitude and direction (clockwise/ anti-clockwise)
* When we have more force acting in the same direction, we can act the moments about the same pivot in the same direction together

## Principle of moments

* **The principle of moments states that when a body is in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a pivot is equal to the sum of anti-clockwise moments about the same pivot**
* For an object to be in equilibrium, all the forces acting on it must be balanced (0 net force) and the resultant moment about the pivot is zero (principle of moments must apply)

## Centre of gravity and stability

* **The center of gravity of an object is defined as the pivot through which the entire weight of the object appears to act for any orientation of the object**

{% hint style="info" %}
* For regular objects, the center of gravity is at is geometrical center
* An object will be balance if supported on/ at it center of gravity
* The center of mass of an object is the point in a body which moves as if the entire mass of the body existed at that point
* The center of gravity coincides with the enter of mass provided that the object is placed in a uniform gravitational field
* The center of gravity is closer to where the heavier part of the body is
* It may also lie outside the body

### Finding the center of gravity of an irregular lamina

1. Hang the lamina from a pin
2. Hand a plumbline from the same pin
3. Draw a line down the lamina along the line of the bob
4. Repeat from one or two more points around the edges of the lamina

* The lamina should be free to swing about the the point of suspension
* Holes must be small to ensure that not too much lamina is removed
* The experiment makes use of the fact that the center of gravity of a freely suspended object will always lie below the point
* Many toys make use of this
* If the center of gravity is not at the pivot, the weight is considered to be acting at where the center of gravity is

### Stability

* **The stability of the object refers to the object's ability to regain its original position after it has been tilted slightly**

  * The base area is as wide as possible
