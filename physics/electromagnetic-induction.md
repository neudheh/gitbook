# ðŸ§² Electromagnetic induction

## Principles of electromagnetic induction

* **Electromagnetic Induction is a process through which an induced e.m.f is produced in a conductor due to a changing magnetic field**
* When an e.m.f is formed in a conductor, it may or may not be an induced current
* If the conductor forms a closed circuit, an induced current will be produced together with the induced e.m.f
* But if the circuit is open, an induced e.m.f may be produced but there will be no induced current

### Faraday's solenoid experiment

* When a magnet was inserted into a solenoid, the galvanometer was deflected in one direction momentarily
* When the magnet was withdrawn from the solenoid, the galvanometer needle was deflected in the other direction momentarily
* When the magnet was stationary in the solenoid, the galvanometer needle was not deflected
* We can conclude that a relative movement between the solenoid and the magnet induced an e.m.f in the circuit, which in turn induces a current to make the galvanometer move

### Faraday's law

* **Faraday's Law** states that the magnitude of the induced e.m.f in a circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux in the circuit
* **Magnetic flux** is a measurement of the total magnetic field which passes through a given area
* The magnitude of the induced e.m.f could be increased by&#x20;
  * The number of coils in the solenoid, increasing the magnetic field in the coil
  * The strength of the magnet increases the magnetic field in the coil
  * The speed at which the magnet was removed with respect to the solenoid increases the rate of change of the magnetic field in the coil
* The direction in which the magnet is moved and the polarity of the end of the magnet being inserted or removed determines the direction of deflection of the galvanometer needle

### Lenz's law

* **Lenz's law** states that the direction of the induced e.m.f and hence the induced current is always such that its magnetic effect opposes the motion or changes producing it

* By Lenz's law, when a south pole approaches a solenoid, a south pole will form at the end of the solenoid

* By Lenz's law, when a south pole moves away from a solenoid, a North pole will form at the end of the solenoid
* **Towards = Repel, Away = Attract**
* The direction of the induced current can be determined by the right-hand grip rule

## A.C. generators

### Fleming's right-hand rule

* If a straight conductor moves in a magnetic field, an e.m.f will be induced in the conductor
* If the conductor forms a complete circuit, then an induced current will flow as well
* The direction of the induced current can be deduced using Fleming's right-hand rule

![](../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_4334-1.jpg)

* Fingers have the same meaning as Fleming's left-hand rule
* The magnetic field points from north to south, while the motion of the wire is upwards.
* The induced current is therefore out of the page, towards you

### A.C. generator

![](../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_4335.jpg)

* It has a single coil or fire in between two magnetic poles and two carbon brushes connected to an external circuit, like the d.c motor
* But, instead of a split-ring commutator, there are two slip rings
* They are in contact with the carbon brushes to ensure that the induced current is transferred to the external circuit while the coil rotates
* There is no battery in the circuit, but there is an electrical load such as a light bulb
* By applying Fleming's right-hand rule to the coil where the AD moves upwards, while BC side move downwards, it can be shown that the current flows in the direction of ADBC
* When the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field, there is no change in the magnetic flux of the coil, hence there is no induced e.m.f in the coil, and no induced current flows through the coil
* The voltage generated by an a.c generator is an alternating voltage, a voltage whose magnitude and direction change periodically

![](../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_4336.jpg)

* We can increase the magnitude of the induced e.m.f by
  * increasing the number of turns in the coil
  * using stronger permanent magnets
  * increasing the frequency of rotation
  * winding the coil around a soft iron core to increase the magnetic flux linking the coil

## Transformers

* A **transformer** is a device that can change a high alternating voltage to a low alternating voltage, or vice versa

Parts of a transformer:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_4337 (1).jpg>)

* When an alternating current passes through the coil on the left, it sets up a changing magnetic field in the soft iron core
* An e.m.f will be induced in the coil on the right as it is linked to the changing magnetic field in the iron core
* The galvanometer needle will deflect left and right continuously as the direction of the induced e.m.f alternates at the same frequency as the alternating current
* The current in the left coil and the induced current in the right core do not flow into the iron core as it is insulated
* The soft iron core is able to concentrate the magnetic field lines (high permeability), this ensures a better magnetic flux linkage between the two coils
* If the alternating current is changed to a direct current
  * If the switch is just closed, the galvanometer needle will deflect momentarily as the magnetic field changes briefly when the switch is closed
  * If the switch is left close for a period of time, no deflection occurs as there is no change in the magnetic field
  * If the switch is just opened, the galvanometer needle will deflect momentarily in the opposite direction when the switch is just closed as the magnetic effect produced is opposite
* The voltage and the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils are related by the formula $$\frac{V_{s}}{V_{p}} = \frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}$$\
  where $$V_{s}$$= Secondary voltage, \
  $$V_{p}$$ = Primary voltage,\
  $$N_{s}$$= number of turns in the secondary coil, \
  $$N_{p}$$= number of turns in the primary coil
* $$\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}$$ is known as the turns ratio
* From the principle of conservation of energy, power in the primary coil is transferred to the secondary coil, as shown by the following formula: $$V_{p}I_{p} = V_{s}I_{s}$$\
  Where $$I_{s}$$= Secondary current,\
  $$I_{p}$$= Primary current
* The formula can be manipulated into $$\frac{V_{s}}{V_{p}} = \frac{I_{p}}{I_{s}} = \frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}$$â€‹
* The formula assumes that the transformer is ideal (100% efficient), so there is no power loss
* Transformers in real life are not 100% efficient&#x20;
  * Heat loss due to the resistance of the primary and secondary coils
  * Leakage of magnetic field lines between the primary and secondary coils
  * Heat loss due to eddy currents induced in the iron core. The iron core is laminated to reduce these eddy currents
* If $$N_{s} > N_{p}$$, then $$V_{s} > V_{p}$$ and $$I_{s} < I_{p}$$ the transformer is a step-up transformer since $$V_{s} > V_{p}$$â€‹
* If $$N_{s} < N_{p}$$ then $$V_{s} < V_{p}$$and $$I_{s} > I_{p}$$ the transformer is a step-down transformer since $$V_{s} < V_{p}$$â€‹

### Transmission of electrical energy

* Electrical energy generated at a power station is transmitted to households and factories using metal cables
* Due to the resistance in the cables, some of the energy is lost in the form of heat (known as Joule heating) or $$I^2r$$ losses
* By increasing the voltage, the current is reduced (because P=VI) hence, less power is lost in the form of heat in the cable during transmission

* The X-Shift control adjusts the position of the trace horizontally
* The Y-Shift control adjusts the position of the trace vertically
* The Y-Gain control amplifies the vertical height of the trace
* The time base controls adjusts how quickly the trace sweeps horizontally across the screen
* When the Y gain is increased, the height of the trace increases, not the amplitude
* When the time base is increased, the width of the pulse decreases, not the period
