# ğŸ”¥ Thermal properties of matter

## Heat capacity and specific heat capacity

* Internal energy is the sum of the internal kinetic and potential energies of a substance
* Motion and temperature affect internal kinetic energy
* Intermolecular bonds (states of matter affect internal potential energy
* An increase in internal energy can cause a rise in temperature (increase in the kinetic component of internal energy)\
  OR\
  Can cause particle to move further away by weakening the bonds between them (increase in the potential component of internal energy
* A decrease in internal energy can cause a drop in temperature (decrease in the kinetic component of internal energy)\
  OR\
  Can cause particle to move farther away by weakening the bonds between then (increase in the potential component of internal energy)
* **Heat capacity is the amount of thermal energy needed to raise the temperature of a substance by 1Â°C or 1K**
* SI unit of J/K, but J/Â°C is more commonly used
* Formula: $$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta \theta}$$, where Q is the thermal energy needed (Joules, J), $$\Delta \theta$$â€‹ is the change in temperature (Degrees Celsius  ,Â°C) and C is the heat capacity (Joules per degree Celsius, J/Â°C)
* **Specific heat capacity is the amount of thermal energy needed to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by 1Â°C or 1K**
* SI unit of J/kg/K, but more commonly used is J/Kg/Â°C
* Substances with higher heat capacities  (or higher specific heat capacities) will require more energy to raise their temperature by **** 1Â°C or 1K
* Formula: $$C = \frac{Q}{m \times\Delta\theta} = \frac{C}{m}$$â€‹, where Q is the thermal energy needed (Joules, J),$$\Delta\theta$$ is the change in temperature (Degrees Celsius  ,Â°C), m is the mass of the substance (kilograms, kg) and C is the specfic heat capacity (Joules per degree Celsius, J/Â°C)
* Specific heat capacity is different for each substance

## Melting and solidification

* **Melting involves change in the state of substance from solid to liquid without a change in temperature**
* **Solidification or freezing involves the change in the state of a substance from liquid to a solid without a change in temperature**
* During melting, thermal energy is absorbed by the substance, and there is an increase in the internal potential energy, overcoming the intermolecular force of attraction, causing the particle to move further
* However, there is no change in temperature of the substance as there is no change in kinetic energy
* During freezing, thermal energy is released by the substance, and there and there is a decrease in internal potential energy, strengthening the intermolecular force of attraction, brining the particles close together to form that of a solid
* However, there is no change in temperature of the substance as there is no change in kinetic energy

## Boiling and condensation

* **Boiling involves the change in the state of a substance from a liquid to gas without a change in temperature**
* **Condensation involves that chane in state of a substance from gas to liquid without a change in temperature**
* During boiling, thermal energy is absorbed by the susbtance, and there is an increase in the in the internal potential energy, over coming the intermolecular forces of attraction, causing the particle to move away from each other to form that of a gas
* However, there is no change in the temperaure of the susbtance as there is no change in kinetic energy
* DUring condensation, thermal energy is released from the susbtance, and there is a decrease in the internal potential energy, strengthening the intemolecular forces of attraction, bringing the parrticles close together to form that of a liquid
* However, there is no change in the temperaure of the susbtance as there is no change in kinetic energy

## Latent heat and specific latent heat

* **Latent heat is the thermal energy absorbed by a susbtance during boiling and melting, and is also the thermal energy rleeases by a susbtance during freezing and condensation**
* **Latent heat of fusion is the amount of thermal energy required to convert a susbtance from solid state to liquid state and vice-versa at a constant temperature**
* **Latent heat of vaporisation is the amount of thermal energy requireed to convert a substance from a liquid state to a gaseous state and vice versa at a constant temperature**
* Both have an SI unit of J/Kg
* Formila: $$L_f = \frac{Q}{m}$$where Q is the thermal energy needed (Joules, J), $$l_f$$â€‹ is the latent heat of fusion (J/kg), m is the mass of the substance (kilograms, kg)
* Substances with higher specific latent heat will require more thermal energy to change their states than substances of the same masses with lower specific latent heat

## Evaporation

* **Evaportaion is a process that convets a liquid to a gaseous state**
* Evaporation requires heat to be absorbed from the the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to decrease, known as the cooling effect of evaporation

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Occurs at a particular temperautr       | Occurs at any temperature                   |
| Relatively fast                         | Relatively slow                             |
| Takes place throughout the liquid       | Takes palce only at the liquid's surface    |
| Bubbles are formed in the liquid        | No bubbles are formed                       |
| Temperature is constant                 | Temperature may change                      |
| External thermal energy source required | External thermal energy source not required |

* Molecules in the liquid absorb thermal energy from their surroundings
* At the liquid surface, molecuels that are more energetic can overcome the donward attractive forces of other molecules can escape into the atmosphere
* The slower moving molecules left behind are less energetic, decreasing the temperature of the liquid
* Higher temeprature of the liquid can increase the rate of evaporation as warmer liquid means that a greater number of molecules are energetic enough to escape
* Higher humidity of surrouding air decreases the rate of evaporation as there will be more water vapor present in the air
* Larger surface are of the liquid increases the rate of evaporation as more molecules can escape from the  exposed surface area
* Lower atmospheric pressure can icnrease the rate of evaporation
* Moment of surrouding air increases the rate of evaporation as moving air removes the liquid molecules as soo as they&#x20;
* Lower boiling point increases the rate of evaporation as the bont between liquid particles are weaker -> lesser thermal energy is needed to change the liquid into gaseous state
