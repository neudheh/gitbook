# ⚖ Mass, weight and density

## Mass

* **Mass is amount of matter in a body**
* Mass cannot be changed by the location, shape and speed of the body

## Inertia

* **Inertia is the reluctance of the object to change its state of rest or motion due to its mass**
* Mass is a measure of inertia
* An object with a greater mass will have greater inertia
* The larger the mass of an object, the harder for the object to start moving , slow down, move faster or change direction

## Weight

* **The weight of an object is the amount of gravitational force acting on it**
* Special case of Newton's second law for an object being pull by gravity (compare w = mg with f=ma)
* SI unit of Newton (N)
* **The gravitational field is the region where a mass experiences a force due to gravitational attraction**
* **The gravitational field strength, g, is defined as the gravitational force acting per unit mass**
* SI unit of newton per kilogram (N/kg)
* Formula: $$g = \frac{w}{m}$$​, where g  = gravitational field strength (newtons per kilogram, n/kg), w = weight (newtons, N), m = mass (kilograms, kg)
* Can be written as w = mg
* g is also known as the acceleration of free fall and also has the unit m/s^2

## Density

* Density is the mass per unit volume
* Formula: $$\rho = \frac{m}{v}$$​, where $$\rho$$​= density (kilograms per meter cubed, $$kg/m^3$$), m = mass (kilograms, kg), v = volume (meter cubed, $$m^3$$​)
* SI unit of kilograms per meter cubed, $$kg/m^3$$
* The density of a substance will determine if it will float or sink in different liquids or gases
* Substances that are less dense than water will float on water, while substances hat are denser than water will sink in water
