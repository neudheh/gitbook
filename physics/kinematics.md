## Distance and displacement

* Scalar quantities are physical quantities that have magnitude only (distance/ length, speed, mass, energy, time)
* Vector quantities are physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction (displacement, velocity, acceleration, force)
* **Distance is the total length covered by an object irrespective of the direction of motion**
* **Displacement is the distance measured in a straight line in a specific direction**
* Distance is a scalar quantity while displacement is a vector quantity
* The SI unit for both distance and displacemnt is the metre

## Speed, average speed and velocity

* **Speed is the rate of change of distance**
* Formula:$$V = \frac{d}{t}$$, where v = speed (metres/second), d = distance (m), and t = time (s)
* However, in real life, most object do not move at constant speeds at all the time, with starts and stops, speeding up and slowing down
* It is more useful to define the average speed
* Formula: Average soeed = total distance travelled / total time taken
* SI unit of metre per second (m/s), and a more common unit is kilometer per hour (km/h)
* 1 km/h  = 1000m/3600s = 0.278 m/s
* 1m/s  = 0.001km/(1/3600)h = 3.6 km/h
* **Velocity is the rate of change of displacment**
* Speed is a scalar quanitiy with only magnitude, while velocity is a vector quantitiy with both magnitude and direction
* Same unit as speed
* A body moving with a constant speed along a straight line has constant or uniform velocity
* A negative velocity indicates that a body is moving in an opposite direction

## Acceleration

* Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity
* Formula: $$a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$, where a = acceleration (meter per second squared, $$m/s^{-2})$$, $$\Delta V$$ =  change in velocity (m/s), $$\Delta t$$ = time taken (seconds, s)
* Acceleration is a vector quantity as it has a direction and the direction of acceleration is the direction of change in velocity
* Si unit of meter per second squared $$(m/s^{-2})$$
* A body is said to decelerate when
  * its speed changes, but the direction of travel remains the same
  * Its speed and direction bot change
  * Its speed remains the same but the direction of travel changes
* When a boy changes its velocity to become slower, we can say that the body is&#x20;
  * decelerating (deceleration) (note, no negative sign)
  * is slowing down
  * has a negative acceleration

## Displacement-time graphs

* The gradient of the graph gives the velocity of the object
* A constant gradient of a straight line graph means that the object is moving with constant velocity
* The velocity for a non-liner displacement-time graph takes on different values

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="graph 1" %}
<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png" alt="" data-size="original">

* Displacement remains the same at all times, therefore the object is not moving
* Velocity of 0 m/s
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 2" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (48) (1).png>)

* The object is at a certain distance from its starting point
* Displacement remain the same at all times, therefore the object is not moving
* Velocity of 0 m/s
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 3" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

* The graph shows distance increasing uniformly with time, therefore the object is moving with uniform speed
* Uniform velocity with 0 m/s^2 acceleration
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 4" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)

* The graph shows distance decreasing uniformly with time
* Therefore, the object is moving with uniform speed
* Uniform velocity with 0 m/s^2 acceleration
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 5" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

* The displacement is changing non-uniformly with time
* For equal time intervals, the change in displacement is increasing
* Increasing displacement with increasing velocity
* Acceleration > 0 m/s^2
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 6" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png>)

* The displacement is changing non-uniformly with time
* For equal time intervals, the change in displacement is decreasing
* Increasing with decreasing velocity
* Acceleration <0 m/s^2
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* For an object that does not move with uniform speed, its displacement-time graph will not be linear
* We can only find the gradient of the graph at specific point by taking the tangent that point of the curve and we will only be finding the instantaneous speed in this case

## Velocity-time graph



*

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="graph 1" %}
<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png" alt="" data-size="original">

* Velocity remains at 0m/s as time increases, therefor the object is not moving
* Velocity of 0m/s, acceleration of 0m/s^2, distance travelled
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 2" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (48) (1).png>)

* The velocity remains at a constant value as time increases, therefore the object has a uniform speed
* Constant velocity, 0m/^2 acceleration, and the distance travelled it the area of the rectangle under the graph
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 3" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

* The velocity is increasing uniformly as time increases
* Velocity is increasing uniformly, acceleration is constant, and the distance travelled is the area of the triangle under the graph
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 4" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)

* The velocity is decreasing uniformly as time increases
* The velocity is decreasing uniformly, the acceleration is negative and constant and the distance travelled is the area of the triangle under the graph
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 5" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

* For equal time intervals, the change is velocity is getting bigger and bigger
* The velocity is increasing at an increasing rate, and the acceleration is decreasing&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="graph 6" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png>)

* For equal time intervals, the change in velocity is getting smaller and smaller
* Velocity is increasing at a decreasing rate, and the acceleration is decreasing
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* For graphs 5 and 6, we do not calculate the distance travelled from the area under the v-t graphs as distance under graph is non-linear (can be estimated)
* Displacement and velocity are vectors, meaning it has direction, and can have negative values when travelling in opposite direction
* The area travelled is between the graph and the time axis

## Acceleration due to gravity

* When we drop an object, gravity acts on it causing it to fall
* It is under the influence of a gravitational field
* The force of gravity experience by the falling object  is commonly refers to as the weight of the object
* In the absence of air resistance, all objects falling ins a uniform gravitational field increases their speed at the same rate of 10 m/s for every second (i.e.. it has an acceleration of 10 m/s^2)
* In a vacuum, a feather and a hammer falling together will follow the same pattern and fall at the same rate

## Terminal velocity

* Air resistance is a frictional force that opposes the motion of falling objects, and objects moving in any direction
* Air resistance
  * Always opposes the motion of moving objects
  * Increases with the speed of the object
  * Increases with the surface area or size of the object
  * Increases with the density of the air
* Terminal velocity is when the air resistance is equal to the weight of the object, causing it to travel at a fixed velocity until it hits the ground
