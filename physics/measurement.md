# 📏 Measurement

Physical quantities and SI units

* A physical quantity is a quantity that can be measured
* It consists of a numerical magnitude and a unit
* To obtain reliable results from experiment, we must make accurate measurements of physical quantities
* There are 7 base quantities and all of the other quantities can be derived from them
* All scientists around the world use these physical quantities and their SI units (Short for Le Systeme International d’Unites in French**)**

| Base quantity       | SI unit  | Symbol |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Length              | meter    | m      |
| Mass                | kilogram | kg     |
| Time                | second   | s      |
| Current             | ampere   | A      |
| Temperature         | Kelvin   | K      |
| Luminous intensity  | Candela  | cd     |
| Amount of substance | Mole     | mol    |

* The standard units and symbols allow scientists and engineers from all over the world to use a common scientific language to communicate effectively with one another

## Prefixes

* Prefixes gives us a very convenient way of expressing quantities, especially those very big or very small

| Prefix | Symbol | Meaning             |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------- |
| Giga   | G      | $$\times 10^9$$​    |
| Mega   | M      | $$\times 10^6$$​    |
| Kilo   | k      | $$\times 10^3$$​    |
| Deci   | d      | $$\times 10^{-1}$$  |
| Centi  | c      | $$\times 10^{-2}$$​ |
| Mili   | m      | $$\times 10^{-3}$$​ |
| Micro  | μ      | $$\times 10^{-6}$$​ |
| Nano   | n      | $$\times 10^{-9}$$​ |

### Orders of magnitude

| Common objects             | Orders of magnitude  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Diameter of Earth          | $$\times 10^7$$​     |
| Length of a football field | $$\times 10^2$$​     |
| Height of a stool          | $$\times 10^{-1}$$​  |
| Diameter of a wire         | $$\times 10^{-3}$$​  |
| Diameter of a human hair   | $$\times 10^{-4}$$​  |
| Size of an atom            | $$\times 10^{-10}$$​ |

## Measurement of length

| Length to be measured     | Suitable instrument           | Precision of instrument |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Several meters            | Measuring tape                | 0.1cm or 1mm            |
| Several centimeters to 1m | Meter rule or half meter rule | 0.1cm of 1 mm           |
| Between 1cm to 10cm       | Vernier caliper               | 0.01cm or 0.1mm         |
| Less than 1cm             | Micrometer screw gauge        | 0.001cm or 0.01mm       |

* Parallax error -> due to incorrect positioning of the eyes when taking readings
* Zero error -> due to imperfect alignment of the zero marks between the main and smaller scales
* Al instruments have parallax error, but only micrometer screw gauge and vernier calipers have zero error
* Zero errors can be eliminated by checking for it before and after taking a measurement, and accounting for it when taking the actual length
* Random errors of measurement can be reduced by repeating the measurements and obtaining the average

### Vernier calipers

* The outside jaws are sued to measure the external diameter or width of an object
* The inside jaws are used to measure the internal diameter or width of an object
* The tail (strip) is used to measure the depth of an object
* There is a main scale in centimeters, and a sliding vernier scale, which is a small sliding scale alongside the main scale that allows us to read a fraction of the smallest interval
* To read a vernier caliper, first read the main scale reading by looking at the marking next to the 0 on the vernier scale
* To read the vernier scale, find the marking which matches any of the markings on the main scale
* Zero errors occur due to wear and tear, and are when the zero markings on the vernier scale do not match with the zero markings on the main scale

| Positive zero error                                                                                                                                                  | Negative zero error                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Micrometer screw gauge

* Turn the thimble until the anvil and the spindle are almost touching the object being measured
* Turn the ratchet to tighten it and stop tightening when the ratchet starts to click to prevent over-tightening
* Each marking on the main scale represents 0.5mm
* Each marking on the thimble scale represents 0.01mm
* Add the readings on the main scale and on the thimble scale to get the final reading

* Positive zero error - thimble scale falls below the datum lime
  * In the example above, the zero error is 0.02mm
* Negative zero error - thimble scale falls above the datum line
  * In the example above, the zero error is -.0.04 mm
* Add and subtract like vernier calipers
* To avoid parallax error, position your eyes directly above the scale

## Measurement of time

* Most commonly measured by using a digital stopwatch
* Although most digital watches provide time precise to 2 d.p. or 0.01s, there are errors due to human reaction time, between 0.3 and 0.5s
* A pendulum can be used to measure time

* One complete oscillation is the pendulum swinging from R to S and back to R again
* As a good practice, when measuring the period of a pendulum, we should record the time  for a number of oscillations (e.g. 20) then obtain the average for one oscillation
* The period of a pendulum can be determined by measuring its length
* The longer the pendulum, the longer its period

## Significant figures

* Make the answer has the same number of significant figures as the raw data that has the lowest number of significant figures
