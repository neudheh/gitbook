# ⚡ Practical electricity

## Uses of electricity

* Many household appliances convert electrical energy to other forms of energy such as
  * Light energy in light bulbs
  * Sound energy in loudspeakers
  * Thermal energy in heating elements
* A heating element is a resistor that heat up rapidly when an electric current passes through them due to their high resistance
* Nichrome is often chosen as the heating element for many electrical appliances because it has high resistivity and high melting point

## Measuring electrical energy

* The rate at which power is converted into other forms of energy (power dissipated) can be calculated using the equation $$P = VI$$, where P = power (Watts, W), V = Voltage (Volts, V), I = Current (Amperes, A)​
* Hence, electrical energy is calculated using the formula $$E =VIt$$​, where E = energy (Joules, J), V = Voltage (Volts, V), I = Current (Amperes, A)​, t = time (seconds, S)
* Using V = RI,
  * $$P = RI^2$$​
  * $$E = RI^2t$$
* Using $$I = \frac{V}{R},$$​
  * $$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$
  * $$E = \frac{V^2}{R}t$$
* The equation $$P = RI^2$$​is useful for comparing the power dissipated by resistors in series since the current is the same
* The equation $$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$​ is useful for comparing the power dissipated by resistors in parallel since the p.d. V is the same
* A kettle with a rating of 240V 2000W means that when a voltage of 240V is applies across it, the electrical energy is converted to thermal energy at a rate of 2000W
* The rating allows us to calculate the resistance of the kettle's heating element
* The Kilowatt-hour is a larger unit of energy, as electrical meters may not be able to record the amount of energy used if it was recorded in joules due to it being very large\\
* 1kWh = Power dissipated in 1kW appliance in 1h = 1kW x 1h = 1kW x 3600s = 3600000J

## Sources of electrical energy

* Renewable energy is energy that can be replenished naturally
  * Examples are solar, hydroelectric and wind power
* Non-renewable energy is energy from natural sources that cannot be replenished at a sustainable rate
  * Examples are fossil fuels and nuclear power

## Dangers of electricity

### Live and neutral wires

* A live wire is the wire with a high potential and delivers current to the appliance
* The neutral wire completes the circuit by providing a returning path to the supply and has zero potential and it also has the same current as the live wire

### Damaged insulation

* Damaged insulation can cause electric shocks if someone touches the live wire
* Can cause the wire due to over heating of cables due to the high current created by a short circuit

### Overloaded power sockets

* Overheating of cables due to high current
* Causes a fire

### Damp/ wet conditions

* Causes electric shocks as water conducts electricity

## Safe use of electricity at home

### Circuit breakers

* A circuit breaker switches off the electrical supply when excessive current flows through the circuit
* Installed on the live wire
* When a high current passes through the circuit breaker, the solenoid becomes more strongly magnetized and attracts the soft iron latch
* The spring pushes back the safety bar, breaking the circuit
* When the fault is repaired, the circuit breaker can be rest by pressing the switch back into its original position to close the circuit again

### Fuses

* A fuse consists of a thin metal wire which will melt or blow when the current becomes too high
* It has a fuse rating which indicates the maximum current that can flow before it blows
* It is installed on the live wire&#x20;
* Fuse rating should be slightly higher than the operating current

### Switches

* Switches are designed to break or complete an electric circuit
* They should be installed on the live wire of the appliance so that the appliance will be at zero potential when the switch is open
* **If the switch is connected to the neutral wire, the current will be cut off but the appliance will still be at live potential, and this is dangerous as the user/repairman will get an electric shock if he were to touch the internal components of the appliance**
* **This is the same reason why the fuse and the circuit breaker are installed on the live wire**

### Earthing

* There are three wires in the home circuit
  * Live wire (brown)
  * Neutral (blue)
  * Earth (Yellow and green)
    * Low resistance wire connected tot he metal casing of the appliances to prevent users from getting electric shocks
    * At 0V when no fault occurs

{% hint style="info" %}
Easy trick to remember:

You touch the live wire, you yell out shit, which is brown

The earth wire is green like the earth

idk about neutral&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* When an electrical fault (e.g. damaged insulation) causes the live wire to be in contact with eh metal casing, the metal casing will become live
* Current will flow to the ground due to the earth wire and the fuse will blow due to the high  current caused by the short circuit
* Due to the blown fuse, the casing will no longer be live and the person who unknowingly touches the metal casing will not get an electric shock
* If there is no fuse, the high current will continue to flow and cause a fire (overheating), thus the earth wire must be used with the metal casing

### 3-pin plugs

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The cartridge fuse protects the appliance when there's an electrical fault
* The earth wire protects the user from electric shocks in the event that an electrical fault causes the appliance to be live

### Double insulation <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png" alt="" data-size="line">

* Some appliances have plastic casings instead of metal casings
* They have plugs that have 2 pins instead of 3
* They do not have an earth wire
* Instead they have double insulation to protect users from electric shocks
* Their internal cables are insulated from the internal components of the appliance
* Their internal components are insulated from the outer casing
