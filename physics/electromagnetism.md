# ðŸ§² Electromagnetism

## Magnetic effect of a current

* A current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field around it
* The magnetic field of a straight, current-carrying wire consists of concentric circles
* The magnetic field is stronger closer to the wire
* The right hand grip rule can be sued to determine the direction of the magnetic field created by a straight wire carrying a current
* Thumb points in the direction of the current
* The direction of the magnetic field of a current-carrying wire reverses when the direction of the current is reversed
* The other fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field

* A coil with many turns is called a solenoid

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
The magnetic field lines are directed from the north pole to the south pole **outside** the solenoid, but they are directed from the south pole to the north pole **inside** the solenoid&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* The magnetic field of a solenoid is identical to that of a bar magnet
* The right hand grip rule is different when applied to a solenoid than when applied to a straight current-carrying conductor (see [here](magnetism.md#magnetization-and-demagnetization) under the electrical method of magnetization)
* The strength of the magnetic field of a solenoid can be increased by
  * Increasing the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid
  * Increasing the magnitude of the current
  * Placing a soft iron core within the solenoid
* The magnetic effect of a current is used in circuit breaker

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)

* When a large current passes through the circuit breaker, the solenoid become more strongly magnetized and attracts the soft iron latch
* The spring pushes back the safety bar, breaking the circuit by opening the interrupt point
* When the fault is repaired, the circuit breaker can be reset by pressing the switch, pushing the safety bar back into its original position and closing the interrupt point

## The motor effect - forces due to magnetic fields

* The magnetic field due to a current-carrying wire interacts with the magnetic field between two magnetic poles
* The interaction between the magnetic fields interaction results in a combined magnetic field that has a region with a **stronger magnetic field and a region with a weaker magnetic field**
* This results in a force that acts from the stronger magnetic fields to the weaker magnetic field
* We can use Fleming's right hand rule to deduce the direction of the force acting on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field

{% hint style="info" %}
Easy trick to remember Fleming's left hand rule

* The current will kill you, so its rude and is the middle finger
* The force is always the big boi, and thus the thumb
* Through elimination, the magnetic field is the index finger
{% endhint %}

### Forces between two parallel carrying conductors

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

**Opposite direction**

* When currents are flowing in opposite directions,  the region in between the wires is where the magnetic fields intersect, and thus a stronger magnetic field is in the middle
* The region outside has the current carrying conductors has the magnetic fields cancelling each other out, and thus it is weaker
* The force acts from a region of a stronger magnetic field towards the weaker magnetic fields, thus the two current-carrying conductors repel each other

**Same direction**

* The region in between the wires has magnetic fields that cancel each other out, resulting in a weaker magnetic field in the middle
* The region surrounding the wires has mag magnetic fields that intersect each other, thus a stronger magnetic field is outside
* The force acts from a region of a stronger magnetic field towards the weaker magnetic fields, thus the two current-carrying conductors attract each other

### Force on a positively charged particle in a magnetic field

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

* Positive particles always have a current in the direction they are traveling in, while negative particles have a current in the opposite direction they are traveling in
* Using Fleming's left hand rule, we can deduce that the positive charge is deflected upwards due to the upwards force acting on it

## Turnining effect on a current-carrying coil in a magnetic field

* Using Fleming's left hand rule, we can deduce that the negative charge is deflected downwards due to the downwards force acting on it

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-08-10 165551.png>)

* Applying Fleming's left-hand rule, an upward force is produced on the left side of the coil, and a downward force acts on the right side of the coil
* These forces will create a turning effect in the clockwise direction about the axis of rotation
* Hence the coil will start to turn in the clockwise direction

What happens if the coil has turned 90Â° and goes past the vertical position?

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

* Using Fleming's left hand rule, an upward force is produced on the top side and a downward force is produced on the bottom side of the coil
* These forces will create an anti-clockwise moment about the axis of rotation
* The coil will then rotate anti-clockwise

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

* Once it goes past the vertical position to the left, a clockwise moment will be produced instead

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

* Hence the coil will rotate to and fro and finally comes to rest with the coil in the vertical position
* Although there are still forces acting on the coil, no moment is produced because the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the pivot is zero

### The DC motor

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)

* Main components
  * A single rectangular coil of wire mounted on an axle
  * A permanent magnet
  * Split right commutator
  * Two carbon brushes connected to an external circuit with battery and rheostat
* The split ring commutator is fixed to the coil and rotates with the coil
* Side AB is connected with section X of the ring while DC is connected to the section Y of the ring
* The carbon brushes are fixed to the external circuit and does not rotate with the coil
* The current flows into brush 1 and out of brush 2

### Function of the split ring commutator

* The split ring commutator allows the current in the coil to change every half a revolution
* The forces acting on the sides of the coil will also reverse every half a revolution
* **This ensures the the direction of turning effect created due to the forces is always the same and hence causes the coil to rotate continuously in the same direction**

* The coil starts at a horizontal position
* Current flows into brush one and section X, which is connected to side AB
* So the direction of current in the coil is in the direction ABCD
* Forces on sides AB and CD cause the coil to rotate anti-clockwise

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>) ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

* After one-quarter of a revolution, the coil is at the vertical position
* The current is cut off because of the open circuit created by the gaps in the split-ring commutator

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>) ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

* The coil rotates past the vertical position due to inertia
* The split ring commutator reconnects with the carbon brushes
* But, ring X is now connected to brush 2 instead of brush 1 so the current flows into section Y which is connected to side DC
* The current flows in the direction DCBA
* Hence the current direction is now reversed and the forces acting on sides AB and CD are also reversed
* This causes the coil to continue to rotate in the anti-clockwise direction

State 3 ways to increase the turning effect of the motor

* Increase the magnitude of the current
* Increase the number of turns of the single coil of wire
* Insert a soft iron core into the coil to increase the magnetic field strength
