# ðŸ”¥ Transfer of thermal energy

## Transfer of thermal energy

* A net transfer of thermal energy occurs only when there is a difference in temperature
* Net thermal energy always flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature
* When two objects are in thermal equilibrium, they are in thermal contact and have the same temperature, and there is no transfer of heat
* There are three main ways heat can be transferred: Conduction, convection and radiation

## Conduction

* **Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy through a medium by vibrations of the particles without any flow of the medium**
* Particles at the hot end will vibrate more vigorously about their fixed positions
* They collide with neighboring particles, transferring kinetic energy to them
* Eventually, the particles at the cooler end are also set in vigorous vibration, and become hot
* Metals are better thermal conductors as they can transfer thermal energy through free electron diffusion as well
* The free electrons gain kinetic energy and move with greater speed to the cooler regions of the rod
* They collide with the particles in the cooler parts of the rod and make them vibrate vigorously, thus cooler regions of the rod become hot
* Conduction can also occur in liquids and gases, although slower
* Liquid particles are spread far apart and collisions are less frequent
* The frequency of collisions is even lower in gases
* Fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases, making air and water poor conductors of heat

## Convection

* **Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by means of bulk movement of fluid in liquids or gases in convection currents due to differences in density**
* Does not occur in solids as particles in solids are held in fixed position which do not allow for bulk movement due to differences in density

### Heating process

* Water near the heating element gains thermal energy, expands, becomes less dense
* Warmer water then rises
* Cooler water, being denser, sinks to takes its place
* The cycle repeats and this sets up a convection current

### Cooling process

* Air nearest to the cooling unit loses thermal energy, contracts and becomes denser
* Colder air sinks, while warmer air that is less dense rises to takes its place
* The cycle repeats and this sets up a convectional current

## Radiation

* **Radiation is the transfer of thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic waves such as infrared radiation without the aid of a medium**
* Thermal energy from infrared radiation is called radiant heat
* All objects emit radiant heat
* The hotter the object, the more the radiant heat emitted
* A good emitter of radiant heat is also a good absorber
* Dull and black surfaces are better absorbers of radiant heat in an hot environment, and better emitters of radiant heat in a cooler environment
* White and shiny surfaces are poorer absorbers of radiant heat in an hot environment, and poorer emitters of radiant heat in a cooler environment
* The higher the surface temperature of the object relative to the surroundings, the higher the rate of emission of infrared radiation
* A hot larger surface area will emit more infrared radiation at a higher rate
* A cool larger surface area will absorb infrared radiation at a higher rate
