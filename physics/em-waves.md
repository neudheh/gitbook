# ðŸŒŠ EM waves

## What is an EM wave? <a href="#_rfrsaolgmthm" id="_rfrsaolgmthm"></a>

* Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves and are produced by both electric and magnetic fields
* They can travel through vacuum
* They travel at the speed of 3 x 10^8 m/s in a vacuum
* They transfer energy from one place to another
* When they travel from one medium to another, frequency does not change but speed and wavelength do
* They do not carry any electric charge
* They obey the laws of reflection and refraction

* In increasing frequency, and in decreasing wavelength
* More frequency â†’ more energy â†’ decreasing wavelength
* Longer wavelength â†’ longer distance travelled

### Uses of electromagnetic waves <a href="#_8ybchqcy8cpn" id="_8ybchqcy8cpn"></a>

* Radio waves
  * Radio can receive radio waves as they have the longest wavelengths and can travel around obstructions
* Microwaves
  * Satellite communication
  * Microwave ovens ( They can penetrate the food and cause the water molecules inside to vibrate a million times a second and generate heat from frictions)
* Infrared
  * Remote controls
* Visible light
  * Optical fiber cables
* Ultraviolet
  * Disinfection of hospital equipment
* X Rays
  * Checking for flaws in heavy metal equipment
* Gamma rays
  * Treatment of cancer\

* Ultraviolet. X-rays and Gamma rays are ionizing radiation which are able to damage living cells and lead to abnormal patterns of cell division.
* Can lead to cancer and cause developing fetus to be deformed
* Called **ionizing radiation**s as they have the ability to remove electrons from atoms or molecules
* When absorbing any electromagnetic waves, the molecules will vibrate, and gain kinetic energy and potential energy (ONLY IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN STATE)
