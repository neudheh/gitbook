# ðŸ”Š Sound

* Sound is produced when objects vibrate in a medium
* Sound travels by disturbing particle and causing them to vibrate, which causes neighbouring particles to be disturbed and vibrate as well
* Sount is thus propagated to transfer energy without transferring matter, making it a wave
* Sound is a longitudinal wave as the vibration of air particles is parallel to the direction in which the wave travels

#### How does the sound of a hammer striking a bell travel through the air to reach the ear of the person striking the bell?

* Sound travels in air by causing layers of air particles to displaced, setting up a series of compressions and rarefactions to travel outwards and propagate though the air to reach the ear of the person
* The direction of the air particles is parallel to the direction in which the soundwave travels

## Terms for sound

* A compression is a region where air particles are closer than they normally are (higher pressure than surrounding air particles)
* A rarefaction is a region where air particles are further apart then they normally are (lower pressure than surrounding air particles)
* The amplitude of a sound wave is the furthest displacement from its original position
* The wavelength of a sound wave is the distance between the middle of two compressions/ rarefactions (two points on phase)

## Graph of sound waves

### Pressure-distance graph

* Can be plotted to show how the pressure changes with distance form the source
* The air pressure in a compression is higher than surrounding air pressure
* The air pressure in a rarefaction is lower than surrounding air pressure

### Displacement-distance graph

* Shows the displacement of the wave particles at different distances from the source at a particular point in time
* 0 is the equilibrium position, and the highest point is the amplitude and the lowest point is the amplitude but negative

### Displacement-distance graph

* Shows the displacement of one particular particle in a sound wave over a period of time
* The particle moves backwards, then back to its resting position, and then back to its resting position again
* T is the period of the particle

## Transmission of sound

* Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because a medium is required to transmit sound
* The speed of sound depends on how closely packed the atoms in a medium are
* Fasts in solids, slowest in gases
* The speed of sound can be determined by taking the distance travelled divided by the time taken

## Reflection of sound (echo)

* Echos are due to the reflection of sound waves
* Can be used to measure distances e.g. determine the depth of the seabed using sonar (**So**und **N**avigation **A**nd **R**anging)
* Depth = speed of sound in sea X 1/2 X time taken for echo to return

## Ultrasound

* Ultrasound is sound with frequencies above 20,000Hz (20kHz), which is outside the range of audible frequencies for a person (20Hz to 20,000Hz)
* Inaudible to humans
* Used for
  * Quality control (measure the thickness of concrete slabs or check for cracks in them)
    * If there is a crack, there will be two reflections of sound because there is a change in medium (air in the crack)
    * If there are no cracks, there will only be 1 reflection of sound
  * Parental scanning to monitor the development of unborn babies

## Loudness and pitch

* The loudness of a sound wave is determined by its amplitude
* The larger the amplitude, the louder the sound
* The pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound wave
* The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch
