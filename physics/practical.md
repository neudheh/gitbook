# ðŸ§ª Practical

## Taking readings

* Recording readings - Record to the correct precision of the instrument
  * Measuring cylinder: $$0.5cm^3$$
  * Spring balance: $$0.05N$$
  * Thermometer: $$0.5 \degree C$$
  * Voltmeter (0-3V): 0.05V
* Ensure the range with wide enough (for ruler, at least 60.0cm)
* 5 sets for a straight line graph, and 8 for a curve

## Calculations

* Take the answer to the lost number of significant figures in the calculation
* Numbers that were never measured cannot affect the number of significant figures in the answer
* Only round when the calculation is finished
* Significant figures do not include placeholder zeros (0.015 is 2 s.f.)
* Must be written even if the statement is in standard form, or in converted into units hat are multiple or divisions of the original (15.0cm -> 0.150m)

## Recording readings

* Have units
* In a table, the heading must have the symbol of the quantity that is measured, followed by its unit

## Drawing graphs

* Draw with a sharp pencil
* Scale should have quantity and units, and have scales of 2cm representing 1, 2 or 5 units (or 10, 20, 50)
* Points should be an accurately (up to half a small square), and plotted with a cross
* Draw a best fit line with points on either side of the line over its entire length, and exclude any anomalies
* To find a gradient, draw a gradient triangle from two points (a dotted right angle triangle form both points, and write the coordinates of the points)
* Directly proportional - Pass through the origin
* Linearly related - Does not pass through the origin, but still a straight line

## Sources of error

### Mechanics

* There will be error in the stopwatch timings due to human reaction time (0.3-0.5s), and the period of the pendulum calculated will not be accurate
* The spring balance and the string are not exactly horizontal as it is difficult to mount them horizontally, and the angles and force will not be accurate
* The strings are being pushed when the protractor is being placed against them to measure the angle, hence it cannot be measured accurately
* Determining the objects' center of mass is not precise, affecting the readings

### Thermal physics

* Heat is lost to the surroundings
* Temperature throughout water may not be uniform because stirring is difficult with the mass in the cup
* The initial temperature may not be the one recorded
* Some water clings onto the mass and increases the mass of the water in the cup
* Density of water may not be accurate
* It is difficult to take the temperature exactly at the planned time as it is hard to look at bo the stopwatch and thermometer

### Light

* The glass block with bevelled edges makes it hard to replace on the exact position each time
* The mirror is very light and shifts easily, causing errors in the angle of incidence and hence emergent ray
* The point is not exactly at the glass block due to the thickness of the pin

### Electricity

* The wire becomes hot after some time and the value of the current mau be different as the resistance increases when temperature increases
* The wires are not of uniform thickness, and current and voltage taken at each point might not reflect the actual values
* There are kinks in the wire (hehe) and it cannot be straightened on the ruler, causing some inaccuracies in the readings of length
* Contact of jockey is not consistent causing some variations in the reading of current
