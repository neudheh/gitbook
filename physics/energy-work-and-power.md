# üèé Energy, work and power

* **Energy is the capacity to do work**
* S.I. Unit of Joules (J)
* **The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, bet can be converted from one form to another. The total energy in an isolated system is constant**
* **Efficiency is the ratio of the total useful energy output to the total energy input, expressed as a percentage**

| Energy                  | Associated with                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Kinetic                 | Moving or vibrating objects     |
| Gravitational potential | Position or height of an object |
| Elastic potential       | Stretched or compressed spring  |
| Chemical potential      | Battery                         |
| Heat                    | Temperature of an object        |
| Light                   | Light bulb                      |
| Sound                   | Music from a radio              |

* In the real world, there are both energy supplied to any system and energy lost in the from of heat, ligth or sound due to resistive forces such as friction and resistance\\
* Sum of initial energies in the system  + Energy gaines or work done in the system = sum of final energies in the system + energy lost from the system
* No system is 100% efficent, but to simplify calculations, assumption of no energy losses is made
* To account for energy losses, students must specity the forms in which energy is lost and the attrubuting forces

## Work

* **Work done is the product of force and the distance travelled in the direction of the force**
* Equal to the energy supplied to the system
* When an object moves in the direction of the force applied, work is done
* When the object does not move or moves in a direction perpendicular to the force applied, no work is done
* Work done can be calculated from the area under a force-displacement graph for a particular distance travelled by the force applied
* Scalar quantity with magnitude and direction
* Work done must be specific to the object that applied the force
* Many types of work done
  * Work done by force = Force X distance traveled by object in the same direction
  * Work done against gravity = Weight X vertical distance gained
  * Work done against friction = Frictional force X distance traveled by the object
* Gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy are collectively known as mechanical energy
* Kinetic energy is energy due to motion
* Formula: $$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$, where $$E_k$$= Kinetic energy (joules, j), m = mass (kilograms, kg), v = velocity of object (meter per second, m/s)
* Gravitational potential energy is energy due to position
* Formula: $$E_p = mgh$$‚Äã, where $$E_p$$‚Äã= gravitational potential energy (joules, j), m = mass (kilograms, kg), g = gravitational field strength (newtons per kilogram, N/kg), h = height to which object is raised
* SI unit of joules, J

## Power

* **Power is the rate of work done or rate of energy conversion**
* SI unit of watt (W)
* Formula: $$P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{E}{t}$$‚Äã, where P =  power (Watts, W), W = amount of work done (Joules, J), E = Energy converted (Joules, J), T = time (Seconds, S)
