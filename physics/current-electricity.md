# ⚡ Current electricity

## Electric current

* **Current is the rate of flow of charge**
* A current is produced when electrons (electric charges) move
* Formula: $$I = \frac{Q}{T}$$, where I = Current (Amperes, A), Q = Charge (coulomb, C), T = Time (seconds, s)
* Scientists believed that an electrical current consisted of moving positive charges, and were later proven to be wrong, but the idea was retained and called the convectional current
* **Convectional current is in the opposite direction to electron flow**

{% hint style="info" %}
When we talk about current in physics, we are referring to convectional current and not electron flow.

The longer line on a cell is the positive terminal, and the shorter line is the negative terminal

* Convectional current flows from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal
* Direct current is a current that flows in only one direction, while alternating current is current that changes periodically
* Can be measured using an ammeter connected in series to the circuit components
* It has very low resistance so the resistance across it is negligible

## Electromotive force

* **Electromotive force is the work done by a source in driving a unit charge around a complete circuit**
* It is not a force
* Formula: $$\varepsilon = \frac{W}{Q}$$, where $$\varepsilon$$​= e.m.f (Volts, V), W = Work Done (Joules, J), Q = Charge (Coulombs, C)
* When cells are arranged in series, the total e.m.f is the sum of the individual e.m.f of each cell
* When cells are arranged in parallel, the total e.m.f is the same as the e.m.f of each cell

### Potential difference

* **Potential difference (p.d.) across a component in a circuit is the work done to drive a unit charge across the component**
* Formula: $$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$, where V= p.d. (Volts, V), W = Work Done (Joules, J), Q = Charge (Coulombs, C)​
* A lamp of 3 V means that the work done needed to drive a unit charge across the lamp is 3 J
* E.m.f is not the same as p.d., as e.m.f is provided by a source of electrical energy whereas p.d is the electrical energy converted to other forms by a circuit component
* E.m.f and p.d. can be measured using a voltmeter which is connected in parallel to the component
  * Has a high resistance so the current flowing through it is negligible

## Resistance

* **The resistance of a conductor is the ratio of the potential difference across it to the current flowing into it**
* Formula: $$R = \frac{V}{I}$$, where R = resistance (ohms, Ω), V = voltage (Volts, V), I = current (Amperes, A)
* A resistor is a device that is used to control the size of the current in a circuit
* It is a conductor of electricity as it allows current to flow through it
* The resistance of a circuit component can be determined by connecting an ammeter in series with the component to get the current flowing through the component and connecting a voltmeter in parallel to the component to get the potential difference across it
  * Using these two values, calculate the resistance using the formula

### Variable resistor

* By moving the slider along the metal rod, the length of the wire through the current flows can be varied
* This causes the resistance to be varied as resistance depends on the length of wire through which the current flows
* If the slider is moved to the right, resistance is increased, and vice-versa

### Ohm's law

* **Ohm's law states that the current passing through a metallic conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it, provided that physical conditions such as temperature remain constant**
* Since $$I \propto V$$, $$\frac{V}{I} =$$Constant = Resistance
* Therefore, the resistance of a metallic conductor remains constant, provided that physical conditions such as temperature remain constant
* Conductors that obey Ohm's law are called ohmic conductors
  * The gradient of a V-I graph is $$\frac{1}{R}$$
  * The graph shows that the current is directly proportional to the voltage
* Non ohmic conductors are conductors that do not obey ohm's law

#### Filament lamp

* As the p.d. across the conductor increases, it gets heated up and the temperature increases, causing resistance to increase as the temperature is no longer constant

#### Semiconductor diode&#x20;

* A semiconductor diode is a device that allows current to flow in one direction only
* When the voltage is negative, resistance is extremely high, causing current flowing through the diode to be negligible
* When the voltage is positive, the resistance decreases sharpy and the current flow sharply as well

* The variable resistor allows the resistance to be changes, allowing us to obtain different sets of voltage and current readings
* With these readings, we can plot our V-I graph or I-V graph

## Short circuits

* A short circuit is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path (bypass) with no or at a a very low electrical resistance
* The current that flows through a short circuit is very high, and can lead to overheating and can cause a fire

## Resistivity

* Resistivity is a fixed property of the conductor with is independent of its dimensions
* Formula: $$R = \frac{ \rho L}{A}$$or $$\rho = \frac{RA}{l}$$, where R = resistance (ohms,Ω), $$\rho$$ = resistivity (ohm/meter, Ω/m), A = cross-sectional area (meters squared, $$m^2$$)
* The resistance depends on its length, the cross sectional area and the type of material it is made out of
* The longer the wire, the larger the resistance and vice versa
* The larger the cross sectional area, the smaller the resistance and vice versa
* Wires used in a circuit are made out of copper as it has a low resistivity, and are short, making them have negligible resistance
