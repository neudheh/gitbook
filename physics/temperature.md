## Temperature

* **Temperature refers to the degree of hotness or coldness of an object**
* **Heat refers to the amount of thermal energy that flows from a hotter region to a cooler region**
* When two bodies are in thermal contact are at the same temperature, there will be not net heat transfer, and we saw that the two bodies are in thermal equilibrium
* The thermometer measures temperature by making use of changes in the physical properties of certain substances due to changes in temperature to measure temperature
* These substances are called thermometric substances
* For a substance to be used as a thermometric substance for a thermometer, the physical property must vary continuously and linearly with temperature and for the range of temperatures to be measured

| Thermometric property               | Substance or object involved          | Type of thermometer         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Volume of a fixed mass of a liquid  | A liquid                              | liquid-in-glass thermometer |
| Induced e.m.f                       | Two metal wires of different material | Thermocouple thermometer    |
| Electrical resistance of a wire     | A metal wire                          | Resistance thermometer      |
| Pressure of a fixed volume of a gas | A gas                                 | Pressure thermometer        |

* Features of a good thermometer
  * Easy-to-read scale
  * Safe to use
  * Responsive to small temperature changes (how fast it reacts to temperature changes)
  * Sensitive to small temperature changes (large change in property per degree Celsius )
* To construct a thermometer that shows the Celsius scale, there are 5 general steps

1. Chose the appropriate thermometric property to be used in the thermometer
2. Chose two fixed points, which should be easily obtainable and reproducible. Usually, the ice point and the steam point are used as the lower and upper fixed points respectively
3. Record the values of the thermometric property at these two fixed points
4. Divide the interval between these two fixed points into 100 equal parts
5. Each of the equal parts on the scale represents a measure of 1Â°C

## Calibrating a thermometer

* The Centigrade of Celsius scale is calibrates using two fixed points
* **The ice point (lower fixed point) is the temperature of pure melting ice at 1 atmosphere. This is 0Â°C**
* **The steam point (upper fixed point) is the temperature of steam from boiling water at one atmosphere. This is 100Â°C**
* The thermometer is placed in pure melting ice, and a mark is made on the thermometer to indicate the level of the mercury column at this temperature after it has stabilized

* The funnel allows the melted ice to flow away so that the temperature only measures the temperature of the pure melting ice
* The thermometer is then placed in steam above boiling water at 1 atmosphere

* Use the manometer to check whether the pressure inside the apparatus is the same as the atmospheric pressure outside
* If the pressure is not equal, adjust the flame accordingly to increase or decrease the pressure inside
* A mark is made on the thermometer to indicate the level of the mercury column at this temperature once it has stabilized
* Formula for thermometer: $$\theta \degree C = \frac{l_{\theta }-l_0}{l_{100}-l_0} \times 100 \degree C$$, where $$l_{\theta }$$= value of property at unknown temperature, $$l_0$$= value of property at ice point, $$l_{100}$$â€‹= value of property at steam point

### Resistance thermometer

* The resistance thermometer uses the thermometric property of electrical resistance of metallic conductors such as platinum
* The resistance of platinum wires varies constantly and linearly with temperature
* Consists of a long resistance wire around a piece of mica in s steam tube
* The formula will not work  if the fixed points given are not the ice point and the steam point, but can be solved using ratio and proportion

### Thermocouple thermometer

* The thermocouple thermometer consists of two types of wires made of different metals such as copper and iron
* In the thermocouple thermometer, the ends of the wires are joined to form two junctions
* When there is a temperature difference between the two junctions, an e.m.f is generated in the wires, which is indicated by a deflection in the millivoltmeter
* The greater the difference in temperature between the two junctions, the greater the e.m.f produced across the two junctions
* The e.m.f induced is proportional to the temperature difference between the two junctions
* To measure temperature using a thermocouple thermometer, first record the millivoltmeter reading, $$\varepsilon _1$$across the two junctions when there are placed at the two fixed points (ice point and steam point)â€‹
* The junction is steam is then removed and placed in the substance whose temperature is to be measured and the new millivoltmeter reading, $$\varepsilon_2$$â€‹is recorded
* Formula: $$\varepsilon \propto \Delta\theta$$â€‹, where $$\varepsilon$$â€‹= e.m.f (millivolts, mV), $$\Delta \theta$$ = difference in temperature between the two junctions (degrees Celsius, Â°C)
