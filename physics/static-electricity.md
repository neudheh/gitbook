# âš¡ Static electricity

## Laws and principles of electrostatics

* There are positive and negative charges
* Charge is measured in coulombs which is its SI unit and has a symbol of C
* An electron carries a charge of $$1.6 \times 10^{-19}$$C
* Unlike charges attract and like charges repel
* Most objects are electrically neutral (equal number of positive and negative charges)
* In order to charge an object one has to alter the charge balance of positive and negative charges

## Charging an object

### Conduction

* This method is used to charge electrical conductors because electrons are free to flow though them
* This process involves touching the uncharged conductor with a charged conductor
* If a negatively charged conductor is used, electrons will be transferred from the charged conductor to the uncharged conductor
* If a positively changed conductor is used, electrons will be transferred from the uncharged conductor to the charges conductor
* Protons cannot move as they cannot be removed form the nucleus of the atom
* Both conductors become positively charged

### Friction

* Rubbing transfers electrons onto or away from the object
* Adding electrons to an object will make it negatively charged because it has more electrons than protons
* Removing electrons from an object will make it positively charged because it has more protons than electrons
* Protons cannot be added or removed as they cannot be removed from the nucleus of an atom
* Commonly used to charge an electrical insulator because electrons are not free to flow through them

* When a glass rod and silk are rubbed together, electrons from the surface of the glass rod are transferred to the cloth
* The rod has an excess of positive charges and thus becomes positively charged
* The cloth has an excess of negative charges and thus becomes negatively charges
* Only the parts that have been rubbed are charged

### Induction

* Induction is the process of charging a conductor without contact
* Electric conductors are usually charged by induction
* The conductor being charged will have an opposite charged used to charge it

1. Place the metal sphere to be charged on an insulating stand, preventing the metal sphere from coming into contact with the ground
   * The ground will neutralize any subsequent charges induced on the sphere
   * No charges are drawn on the sphere as it is neutral, but it does not mean that there are no positive or negative charges, jus that there's an equal amount of positive and negative charges
2. Place a positively charged rod near the surface of the metal, and the free electrons in the metal sphere will be attracted towards the positive charges on the rod
   * This causes the left-hand side of the sphere to have excess electrons and the right hand side to have excess positive charges
3. Earth the metal sphere by connecting it to a ground wire
   * This causes the electrons to flow from the earth into the sphere as they are attracted to the positive charges on the right hand side of the sphere, making it neutral
   * The electrons on the left hand side of the sphere did not move as they are still attracted to the positive charges on the rod
4. Remove the ground wire
5. Remove the charged rod
   * The electrons will repel each other and distribute themselves equally in the charged sphere
6. The metal sphere is charged with a negative charge

Two metal spheres can be charged with only one positively charged rod without grounding or earthing the spheres

1. Place the two spheres in contact with each other and bring the positively-charged rod towards the side of one of the sphere
2. Some electrons from both of the spheres will go towards the positively charged rod
3. Separate the two spheres before removing the charged rod
4. The sphere that is nearer to the charged rod will be negatively charged while the other sphere will be positively charged

## Neutralizing/ discharging

### Insulator

#### Heating with fire

* The heat from the flame ionizes the surrounding air particles, and the ions neutralizes the excess charges

#### Humid conditions

* Water molecules are electrical conductors, and the excess electrons on the insulator will be transferred to the surrounding molecules
* If it is positively charged. electrons will be transferred form the water molecule to the insulator

### Conductor

* A charged conductor can be discharged by earthing it
* Its allows for excess electrons to flow out of the conductor if it is negatively charged
* It allows electrons to flow into the conductor to neutralize the excess positive charges if it is positively charged

## Electric fields

* An electric field is a region in which an electric charge experiences an electric force
* Represented by electric field lines, which can be straight and curved and they do not intersect each other
* They are perpendicular to the objects surface
* The strength of an electric field is indicated by how close the field lines are to one another
* If they are equally spaced, the electric field is uniform
* The direction of an electric field is defined as the direction of the force that would act on a small positive charge
* Away from the positive, and into the negative
* When two isolated point charges are put near each other, their electric fields will interact with each other

## Hazards and applications of electrostatics

### Lightning

* A thundercloud becomes electrically changed due to friction between water molecules in the thundercloud and air particles in the atmosphere
* Negative charges tend to gather at the bottom of the cloud
* This build-up of negative charges in the bottom of the clouds repels the electrons near the ground surface and induces a positive charge on the ground surface
* When the accumulation of charges is large enough, the nearby air particles are ionized, and the ionized air particles provide a conducting path for electrons in the cloud to be conducted to the ground, forming lightning&#x20;

### Electrostatic discharge

* Electric charge can accumulate on petrol tankers due to friction between the road and the rotating tyres
* When sudden discharge occurs, it may cause sparks which could ignite the petrol
* This can be prevented by earthing the tanker
* Older tankers use a metal chain attached to the vehicle to earth the tanker
* Newer petrol tankers use tyres that contain carbon to help discharge the tankers

### Electrostatic precipitators

* Electrostatic precipitators are used to reduce air pollution by cleaning the waste gases produced from power stations
* Fly ashes (mixtures of smoke and dust particles) pick up negative charges from the negatively charged wires as they rise up the chimney
* The fly ashes then stick to the positively charged metal plates as they are negatively charged and unlike charges attract
* Hence, the gases that leave the chimney are free from fly ashes

### Spray painting

* As the paint droplet approach the metal part, electrons will flow up from the ground and accumulate on the surface of the cylinder as they are attracted to the positively charged droplets
* Hence, the surface of the cylinder will be negatively charged and the droplets will stick to they cylinder
* The droplets will have the same charge, and since like charges repel, the paint droplets will repel each other to from an even coat of paint on the cylinder

### Photocopier

* An earthed metal drum inside the photocopier is coated with selenium
* Selenium is a photoconductor, conducting electricity in the presence of light
* The drum's surface is charged positively by a charged wire, and the charged remain on the drum because of the insulated selenium coating
* The object to be photocopied is placed on a sheet of clear glass above the drum
* An intense light beam is shown upwards onto the object&#x20;
* The white paper reflects light onto the drum and the regions on where the drum reflects light are discharged because the selenium becomes conducting and the drum is earthed
* The object absorbs the light and casts a shadow on the drum, hence a positively charged image is formed where the shadow is cast because the selenium in that region remains non-conducting
* The drum continues turning and the positively charged image on the drum attracts the negatively charged toner power
* The drum continues turning and the positively charged image on the drum attracts the negatively-charged toner powder
* A positively charged sheet of apper is passed over the drums surface, attracting the negatively charged toner and the image is formed on the paper
* The paper is heated and pressed to fuse the toner power to the paper permanently

### Lazer printer

* Same thing as photo copier but the image is formed by the laser instead of the shadow of the object
* The region wehre the lazer falls will be discharged, hence the image is neutral rather than charged
* The charged toner is then attracted to the image due to electrostatic indcution
