# ðŸŒŠ General wave properties

## General wave properties

* A wave is a vibration that transferred energy without transferring matter
* A wave is made up of periodic motion (motion repeated at regular intervals)
* The source of a wave is through vibration or oscillation
* In transverse waves, the particles oscillate in the direction perpendicular to wave motion
  * Light waves, water waves, gamma waves
* In longitudinal waves, the particles oscillate in the direction parallel to the wave motion
  * Sound waves ONLY

* Crests are the highest points of a transverse waves
* Throughs are the lowest points of a transverse wave
* The wavelength of a wave is the shortest distance distance between any two points in a wave that are in phase
  * E.g two successive crests or troughs
  * SI unit of m
* The amplitude of a wave is the maximum displacement of a point from its rest position
  * The height of a crest or the depth of a through measured from its rest position
  * SI unit of m
* Any two points in a wave moving in the same direction and having the same speed from their rest positions are said to be in phase
* The period of a wave is the time taken for one point on the waves to complete one complete oscillation
  * Also the time taken by a source to produce one complete wave
  * SI unit of seconds
* The frequency is the number of complete waves produced per second
  * Formula:
  * Si unit of Hz
* Wave speed is the distance travelled by a wave per second
  * Formula:
  * SI unit of m/s
* A wave front is an imaginary line that joins all points in phase
* Wave speed is constant is the same medium
*   Frequency is constant here however, so wave speed changes here
