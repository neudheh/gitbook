# ðŸ’¨ Kinetic model of matter

## The states of matter

### Solid

* Fixed shaped and volume
* Very high density
* Cannot be compressed
* Particles are closely packed in a regular arrangement
* Large number of particles per unit volume
* Held in position by very strong intermolecular forces of attraction
* The particles vibrate about their fixed positions

### Liquid

* Fixed shape but no fixed volume
* Relatively high density
* Cannot be compressed
* Particles are randomly arranged slightly further apart than solids
* Slightly smaller number of particle per unit volume compared to solids
* Strong intermolecular forces of attraction
* The particles are free to move about within the liquid

### Gas

* No fixed shape and volume
* Low density
* Compressible
* Particles are randomly arranged and very far apart form one another
* Very low number of particles per unit volume
* Very weak intermolecular forces of attraction
* Particles will occupy any available space
* Particles move randomly at very high speeds

## Kinetic model of matter

* **The kinetic model of matter states that the tiny particles that make up matter are always in very constant and random motion**
* Brownian motion is a phenomenon that provides evidence for the constant and random motion of tiny particles
* In Brownian motion, the random, continuous motion of particles suspended in fluids is observed
* Pollen grains moving randomly and continuously when suspended in water as smaller invisible water molecules are colliding with the pollen grains as invisible water molecules are moving constantly and randomly

* Tiny smoke particles (seen as bright specks under the microscope) are moving about in a constant and random manner as smaller invisible air molecules are colliding with the smoke particles as they are also moving continuously and randomly
* At higher temperatures, pollen grains in water move more vigorously, and the motion remains random as at higher temperature, the water molecules move at higher speeds and have greater kinetic energy

## Pressure in gasses

* Gas particle collide with the inner walls of the container constantly and randomly
* When they hit the container walls, they exert a force on the wall
* Since pressure is the force exerted per unit area, pressure is produced due to the average force per unit area by collision of gas particles with the inner walls of the container
* The total average force exerted on the walls are dependent on two factors
  * Forcefulness of each Collison (dependent on speed)
  * Frequency of collision (dependent on both speed and volume)

### Pressure-temperature, with constant volume

* At higher temperatures, gas particle have higher kinetic energy and speeds
* With volume remaining constant, the particles will collide with the inner walls of the container more frequently and more vigorously
* The force exerted on the walls per unit area increases, thus pressure increases
* Pressure is directly proportional to temperature at constant volume

### Volume-temperature, with constant pressure

* At higher temperatures, gas particle have higher kinetic energy and speeds
* With volume remaining constant, the particles will collide with the inner walls of the container more frequently and more vigorously
* The force exerted on the walls per unit area increases, thus pressure increases
* To maintain constant pressure, the volume of the container will increase
* As the volume increases, the number of gas particles per unit area decreases
* Hence, the frequency of collisions with the inner walls of the container decreases, which will cause the pressure to decrease back to the constant value
* Volume is directly proportional to temperature with constant volume

### Pressure-Volume, with constant temperature

* When the volume of the container is increased, the number of particles per unit volume decreases
* Hence, the frequency of collisions with the inner walls of the container decreases
* The force exerted per unit area decreases, therefore pressure decreases
* Pressure is inversely proportional to volume with constant temperature
