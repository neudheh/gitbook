# ðŸŒŠ Pressure

## Pressure

* **Pressure is the force acting per unit area**
* Formula: $$P = \frac{F}{A}$$â€‹, where P = pressure (newton per square meter, $$N/m^2$$â€‹), F = force (Newtons, N), A = Cross-sectional area (square meter, $$m^2$$)
* SI unit of â€‹newton per square meter, $$N/m^2$$â€‹ or pascal, Pa
* 1 pascal = a force of 1N acting on an area of 1$$m^2$$â€‹
* Increasing the surface are over which a force acts will decrease the pressure
* Increasing the force acting on an area will increase the pressure

## Pressure in liquids

* Liquids exert a pressure due to their depth
* The greater the depth of a liquid, the greater the liquid pressure due to the larger amount of liquid above
* Formula: $$P = h\rho g$$â€‹, where P = pressure (newton per square meter, $$N/m^2$$â€‹ or pascal, Pa), h = height of point beneath liquid surface (meter, m), $$\rho$$â€‹= density of liquid (kilograms per meter cubed, $$kg/m^3$$â€‹), g = gravitational field strength (newtons per kilogram, $$N/kg$$â€‹)
* Points of the same depth have the same pressure

* The liquid will always find a common level on all sides as the pressure on the surface of the liquids is equal to atmospheric pressure
* Any pressure difference due to difference in height will cause the liquid to flow until the pressure equalizes when the height becomes zero

### Buoyancy force

* **The resultant force due to pressure differences acting on the top and bottom of the object is known as buoyancy force or upthrust**
* Formula: Resultant force due to differences in pressure (Newtons, N) = Net pressure (Pascal, Pa or Newtons per meter squared, $$N/m^2$$) X Cross-sectional area (meters squared, $$m^2$$)
* If the buoyancy force is greater than the weight, the object will float, or else, it will sink

### Pascal's principle

* **Pascal's principle states that an enclosed liquid in an enclosed body allows pressure to be transmitted equally throughout the liquid**
* Hydraulic systems make use of pascal's principle to lift heavy loads

* The hydraulic press is an enclosed system of connected parts containing an incompressible liquid
* A small force can be exerted at one end of the system to life a large load at the other end
* Pressure at X = pressure at Y
* Formula: $$p =\frac{F_x}{A_x}= \frac{F_Y}{AY}$$â€‹, where p = pressure transmitted (Pascal, Pa or Newtons per meter squared, $$N/m^2$$â€‹), F = force applied (Newtons, N), A = Cross-sectional area of piston (meters squared, $$m^2$$)
* The principal of conservation of energy can be used to compare the distance moved by the load and the effortâ€‹
* Work done by effort = work done on load
* Presence of air bubbles in the liquid will affect the efficiency of the hydraulic system because air is compressible, thus pressure will not be equally transmitted to all parts of the liquid
* Oil is preferred over water as the liquid used because it lubricates moving parts, does not evaporate easily and does not cause corrosion

## Gas pressure

* The air surrounding us exerts a pressure on us known as atmospheric pressure
* This pressure is due to the weight of the layer of air above us
* The air pressure at sea level is about $$1.013\times10^5$$â€‹Pa, which is referred to one atmospheric pressure (1 atm)
* Atmospheric pressure can be measured by using a simple mercury barometer

* The pressure at the top of the mercury column is zero because of the vacuum
* Points A and C have the same pressure which is equal to atmospheric pressure as they have been exposed to the air
* Pressure at B is the same as pressure at A and C as the points are at the same level
* Pressure at B is due to the weight of the mercury column above it
* The height of the mercury column is measured from the surface of the mercury in the column to the top of the mercury column&#x20;
* The atmospheric pressure given by a mercury barometer is expressed as the height of the mercury column which can be converted to pascal using this [formula](pressure.md#pressure-in-liquids)
* At sea level, the pressure is equal to 760 mmHg
* The mercury column will change in height if the atmospheric pressure changes
* For example, at higher altitudes, due to thinner layers of air, the atmospheric pressure is lower, thus the height of the mercury column is shorter
* A manometer can be used to measure the pressure difference between gases
* The difference in height of the liquid level in the two arms of the manometer tells us the difference in gas pressures
* The gas connected to the arm with the lower liquid level has a lower gas pressure
* The actual gas pressure can be determined suing both a manometer with one arm exposed to the atmosphere and a barometer for determining atmospheric pressure
