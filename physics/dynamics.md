## The nature of force

* A force is a push or a pull that one exerts on one object onto another with produces or dents to produce motion, stop or tends to stop motion
* SI unit of Newton, N
* Forces are vector quantities, having both magnitude and direction
* When a number of forces act on an object, we can replace these forces with a single force called a net force or resultant force or total force
* When we say that there is zero net force or no net force, it can refer to all the forces on the body is balanced or there are no forces acting on the body at all

## The effects of force on motion

### Newton's first law

* **Newton's first law states that every object will continue in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless a resultant force acts on it to change its state**
* When there is no net force on a stationary object, it will remain at rest
* When there is not net force on a moving object it will travel at a constant velocity
* Applied then there are no force being applied to the object, or when the net force is zero
* Force is needed to make
  * A stationary body move
  * A moving body to increase in speed
  * A moving body to decrease in speed
  * To make a moving body change its direction in which it is moving
* Therefore, a net force causes an object to accelerate

### Newton's second law

* **When a net force acts on an object of constant mass, the object will accelerate and move in the direction of the resultant force**
* **The product of the mass and acceleration of the object is equal to the resultant force**
* Formula: $$F =ma$$‚Äã, where F = force (newtons, N), m = mass (kilograms, kg), a = acceleration (meters per second squared, $$m/s^2$$)

### Newton's third law

* **When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal but opposite force on the first**
* Normally seen as normal reaction (normal contact force), or friction

## Balanced force

* When two or more force acting on an object produces no resultant force, we say these forces are balanced
* The object does not accelerate as it moves in constant velocity
* From newton's first law, we can deduce that the object is either stationary or moving at a constant velocity
* When there is a resultant force acting on an object, then by newton's second law, the object will experience an acceleration

## Friction

* Friction always opposes motion when two surfaces are in contact
* Can be destructive when it causes wear and tear of moving parts in machinery
* Can be reduced by lubricants, wheels, ball bearings and air cushions
* Prevents us from slipping when we are walking, and enables us to walk
* Allow moving bodies to slow down or stop when required
