# 🏮 Chapter 10: How do we respond to tensions arising from some cultural impacts of globalization?

## Cultural homogenization

* Local cultures are being changes by foreign cultures to become more similar with aspects of foreign cultures
* Can lead to some foreign cultural influence being dominant
* Can be positive and negative
* Positive: (English) Cultural homogenization -> increased understanding -> harmony (don't use this unless the questions asks for it

### Entertainment

* Example: The spread of American culture has led to American messages of freedom and individuality in their entertainment products can empower consumers to develop their own identities
  * When Asian middle-class women watch American soap operas, they see that the possibility to marry for love or to live independently of the extended family exists
  * France has voiced its concerns with American films dominating the European film industry and has placed restrictions of foreign media in its entertainment industry
  * China also had in place restrictions which included a limit of 34 annual foreign films that could be imported in 2014
*   **Negative: Negative impact on countries, especially for Asian countries which place more emphasis on the family then on the individuals**

    * **Spread of American culture -> Asians take on the value of individualization and independence -> undermine Asian cultural, moral and religious values as well as threaten the local cultural industry -> disharmony**

    Or

    * **Spread of American culture -> American culture dominates over local culture -> loss of identity/ uniqueness of countries**
*   Example: Since the mid-2000s, South Korea has had a dominant influence in the entertainment industry, spreading through TV dramas, pop music, food, fashion, language, computer games and tourism, and is popularly known as the Korean Wave or _Hallyu_

    * **Positive: Spread of Korean Culture -> enriched diversity of culture -> provides consumers with a wider range of entertainment programs to choose from**

    **OR**

    * **Positive: Spread of Korean Culture ->** increased awareness of Korean culture -> preservation of Korean culture

### Food

*   Example: The popularity of global brands like Starbucks and the Coffee Bean has affected food culture in Singapore due to homogenization

    * People in the past patronized small local coffee shops, but due to globalization, patronizing foreign coffee shops like Starbucks or Coffee Bean has become a way of life in Singapore
    * **Negative: Spread of Foreign food culture -> increased consumption from foreign food establishments -> Decrease consumption of local and traditional food -> decline**

    Or

    * **Negative: Spread of Foreign food culture -> Food landscape can become dominated by foreign food establishments, eroding diversity in the food landscape**
    * **Positive: Spread of Foreign food culture -> Food landscape offers a variety of food options -> Provided locals with easier access to foreign flavors without having to travel out of the country**

## Cultural hybridization

* Foreign and local cultures are blended, resulting in unique combinations containing elements from both cultures

### Entertainment

* Example: When Kung Fu Panda was released in China in 2008, there were calls by some Chinese to boycott the film because it was seen as an inaccurate portrayal of Chinese culture
* **Negative: Inaccurate portrayal of Chinese culture -> Misconceptions and misunderstandings of Chinese Culture -> tensions in society -> Disharmony/ Social instability**

### **Food**

* Example: Fast food is American Culture
  * Due to American dominance in the world, fast food MNCs like McDonald's spread around the world, opening outlets in many different countries
  * For McDonald's to appeal to locals in Singapore, they created fusion foods like "Laksa Burger" or "Rendang Chicken Wing"
  * **Positive: MNCs mixing the positive elements of both local and foreign culture -> enriched diversity of culture -> creates interesting experiences -> Makes local culture even more attractive and accessible for foreigners who wish to experience the local culture as they are already familiar with foreign culture**
  * **Negative: MNCs mixing the positive elements of both local and foreign culture -> fusion/blend of local and foreign culture -> dilution of local culture**
