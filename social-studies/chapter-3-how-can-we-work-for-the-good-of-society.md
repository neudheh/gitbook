## What is the good of society?

* Society can function effectively (political, economic, social, environmental aspects)
* Society developing
* Growth of country
* Security of country - Sovereignty of a country/ peace and safety

## Role of government

### Maintaining internal and external security

* The Singapore government set up various agencies such as the Singapore Police Force (SPF), civil defense forces to protect citizens, property and any kind of societal needs which requires protection

#### External security

* Singapore Army, Singapore Navy, Singapore Air Force all form the Ministry of Defense (MINDEF)
* Army, Navy and Air Forces purpose is to deter aggression and should deterrence fail, ensure a swift and decisive victory
* It should be ready to conduct a spectrum of operations to protect the security interests and sovereignty of Singapore
* The Ministry of Foreign affairs assists in maintaining Singapore's external security through diplomacy
* MFA contributes to the formulation and implementation of Singapore's foreign policy to advance out national interests, assists in maintaining Singapore's external security through diplomacy
* **Deters potential aggression form attacking Singapore -> Creates a sense of order and security/ no chaos/ peace and security/ national security is not threatened -> Stability within the country**&#x20;

#### Internal security

* Internal security refers to law and order in the country through the use of several authorities
* The SCDF's main role is fire-fighting, rescue and emergency service, mitigating hazardous material incidents as well as formulating, implementing and enforcing regulation on fire safety and civil defense shelter matters
* Provide fire-fighting rescue and emergency help/ protect citizens from criminal harm
* **Deters potential aggression form attacking Singapore -> Creates a sense of order and security/ no chaos/ peace and security/ national security is not threatened -> Stability within the country**&#x20;

### Ensuring justice

* Through the judiciary, laws are applied correctly and independently to ensure that people have the confidence that the law will be applied fairly to all
* Example: Personal Protection orders (PPO) against family violence is a court order that prevents someone from being harmed by restricting person from entering the applicant's house or part of the house
  * A PPO will be issued if the court is satisfied that there is family violence or it is likely to be committed, and the PPO is necessary for the applicant's protection
* People can go about their daily lives without having to fear of being hurt
* **Confidence in the government/ Singapore -> Increased sense of belonging -> Want to do his or her best for the country and improve the country**

OR

* **Confidence in the government/ Singapore -> more investors coming in -> develops country economically**

### Providing goods and services for the public

* Governments devote significant resources to improve the well being of citizens
* Citizens enjoy benefits from provision of good and services for the public in their daily lives
* These goods and services are provided for or subsidized by government and citizens can have access to them
* Example: Provision of a people-centered transportation system by constantly upgrading the buses and MRT systems
  * Addition of more MRT routes all over Singapore
  * MRT stations are also built near the residential areas
  * Addition of more MRT routes all around Singapore -> Citizens can travel around easily and quickly -> improved the lives of Singaporeans
  * MRT stations built near the residential areas -> Singaporeans would not have to travel too far to get transportation
* Government provides accessibility and convenience to the people
* **Increases productivity -> People can contribute more to the country**
* **Confidence in government -> People are satisfied with the government taking care of the needs of people -> Increased sense of belonging -> People want to contribute mo**r**e the the country**

### Safeguarding the interests of citizens

* Governments implement legislation that safeguards the interests of citizens to ensure that citizens have a sense of security about living in the country
* Can safeguard the interests of citizens by ensuring that there is no abuse by employers, as well as a sense of security in old age
* Example: Introduction of CPF Life in 2009, a lifelong monthly payout in retirement for elderly Singaporeans
  * Elderly Singaporeans have a greater peace of mind in retirement
  * Help stretch Singaporeans' retirement saving for as long as they live
  * Helps Singaporeans survive financially
* **Feel that that the government cares for them -> Confidence in government -> Wants to contribute to the growth of the country**

## Role of citizens

### Contributing to the needs of society

#### Individuals

* Individuals play an important role in contributing to the needs of society through volunteering their time, effort and money towards meaningful social causes they are concerned about
* Do so as they feel that their actions will be helpful and they feel strongly for the cause they are contributing towards
* Can benefit may people directly and the improvements that result are immediate
* Can also inspire other to make similar improvements
* Example: "A litter at a time" is a project started by Ms Elisa Ng to encourage Singaporeans to pick up the litter around them, maintaining the cleanliness of the environment
  * This individual effort highlights the dedication of the individual in championing environmental causes
  * Her personal reflection and stories would be able to encourage Singaporeans to have similar reflections and possibly encourage them to pick up the litter around them
* **With more Singaporeans being involved in litter picking in different parts of Singapore -> Environment of Singapore is cleaner -> Help to improve the lives of others -> Make Singapore a better place to live in**

#### Formal groups

* Formal groups are organizations with clear objectives and are formally registered with the government
* Address a wide range of interests such as people with special needs and protecting the environment
* Can be of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Voluntary Welfare Organizations (VWOs)
* Example: MINDS, Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore aims to advance the development, well-being and aspirations of people with intellectual disabilities and their integration into society
* **Ensure their needs are taken care of as the government tends to provide generalized support -> Reduces burden of government -> allows them to focus on other groups who need more help or channel resource to other areas to improve Singapore**

#### Informal groups

* Temporarily formed and may not be registered with the government
* Have specific short-term objectives relate to issues that arise suddenly
* When a situation occurs or when a gape is noticed in an area of need, these groups would organize themselves to tend to this specific need
* Example: SG Haze Rescue is an effort by Mr Jeremy Chua asking for people to help and donate excess masks almost immediately after seeing the PSI rise to 321 during the haze crisis
* **Important as they can respond in the fastest time when a specific event happens, and resource ca**n **be gathered quickly in meeting the needs of these events**
* **People in need would be taken care of -> reduces burden of government by sharing their responsibility and contributing to the good of society**

### **Influencing government decisions**

* Feedback and suggestions can influence the decisions made and plans for Singapore
* Citizen feedback and suggestion may enable necessary changes and improvements to be made to proposals and draft plans
* **Allows the government to understand the needs and views of a citizen better**
* **Without such feedback, governments might not have a good or thorough understanding of how certain policies might affect citizens at the ground level**
* **Existing policies may not have even met all of society's needs**
* **Government is able to refine policies for the good of Singapore's society -> helping the government make better decisions and policies for the good of society**

#### Individuals

* Example: Our Singaporean Conversation was a national-level conversation launched in 2012, where Singaporeans could come together to share their view and ideas about what matters to Singapore, as well as their hopes and dreams

#### Organized groups

* Example: Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) improved the working conditions of foreign domestic workers in Singapore by making 1 day off a week mandatory -> Legislation passed in 2013, FDWs can choose to take a day off a week



### **Strengthening citizen's sense of belonging**

* One way to strengthen citizens sense of belonging is to involve citizens in sharing of discussion of views
* Example: \*Scape park, a recreational, social and communal space for youth to showcase, explore and express created by the government
  * Consultations with different interest groups especially youths - over 2,200 youths provided feedback over two moths, involved in design, planning and feedback of the building project
* **Create sense of empowerment and value of citizenship -> helps to foster a sense of belonging -> want to contribute more to improve the country -> country can develop**
