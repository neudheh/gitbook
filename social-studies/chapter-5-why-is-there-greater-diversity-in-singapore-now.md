# ðŸ‘² Chapter 5: Why is there greater diversity in Singapore now?

## Immigration policy

* Singapore's immigration policy has a focus in meeting Singapore's manpower needs

### Industrialization

* Singapore's industrialization program started in 1965, with factories producing garments, textiles, toys, wood products and wigs
* Along with these labor-intensive industries were capital and technology-intensive project -> Demand for more workers
* Addressed by issuing of work permits to foreign workers seeking employment in Singapore in 1971

### Brain drain

* By the 1980s, Singapore was facing a declining population and a brain drain (Migration of highly trained or educated people form another country to other countries at the expense of the country where these people originated)
* Professionals such as doctors found it easier to work over seas in Australia as they could speak English
* Hence, the Singapore government started to encourage another wave of migration to Singapore

### Declining birth rates

* At the current birth rate, and without immigration, the number of working-age citizens is projected to decline from 2020
* Singapore's overall citizen population is also predicted to decline form 2025 onwards if the low birth rates continue to persist
* Elderly citizens will almost double from 440,000 in 2015 to 900,000 by 2025 and will be supported by a smaller base of working-age citizens, worsening old-age dependency ratio
* Taxes on the working-age citizens will have to be increased to support an increasing number of elderly citizens -> higher economic burden
* Shrinking customer base, and will become unattractive for companies to sell to
* Inadequate manpower
* Thus, foreign manpower is needed to mitigate these impacts
* It would promote skills, give valuable experiences and business networks to contribute ideas and expertise to Singapore's economy
* **Industrialization/ brain drain/ declining birth rates -> Need for more foreign manpower-> causes immigration policy to be more lax -> Foreign workers are encouraged to work here -> Increased social-cultural diversity**

## Economic opportunities

* Employment opportunities are readily available due to the large number of businesses that operate here -> attracts immigrants looking for employment that may not exist in their home countries
* Ease of doing business, growth potential, stable political environment and well-established judiciary system attracts Multinational Corporations (MNCs), resulting in Singapore's reputation as a business hub
* Singapore's world-renowned efficiency has attracted about 7000 MNCs to set up operations here
* Example: L'Oreal group in Singapore is an MNC that has many brands offering a variety of positions for job seekers like counter managers, beauty advisors, managerial positions etc
* **More businesses here -> More job opportunities -> More immigrants want to work here -> Increased social-cultural diversity**

## Socio-cultural environment

* Singapore's reputation as a business hub has attracted many professionals to bring their families and settle down in Singapore
* Some have become naturalized citizens -> increase in social-cultural/ social-economic diversity
* One key reason why they chose to settle down in Singapore is because of the social-cultural environment

### Community support

* Besides offering economic opportunities, Singapore is home to a wide range of ethnic communities and cultures from all over the world
* The existence of these communities may help foreigners feel more at home in Singapore
* However, if some foreigners do not interact beyond their immediate community, it may affect their engagement with the larger Singapore society
* Many of these ethnic communities bring with them distinct national identities that can also include ethnic practices unique to their countries of origin
* Example: The Australia and New Zealand Association (ANZA) is an association formed in 1948 to support Australian and New Zealander families based here
* **Community support -> foreigners feel at home in Singapore -> More migrants want to come to work here -> Increased social-cultural diversity**

### Safe environment

* Migrants and immigrants considers safety and security when deciding on the country to work of live in
* Both the foreigners and the supporting communities thrive when there is a safe environment
* The crime rate is often a measure indicating the level of safety in a country
* Singapore's laws play a role in ensuring the relatively low crime rate here
* Example: Crime rates have gone down 5% since 2012 to 2013 from 584 per 100,000 people to 555 per 100,000 people
  * Have been declining since 2005
  * Almost 40% of all major crimes are solved with assistance from the public
* **Singapore's safe environment -> Immigrants can have peace of mind when working/ living in Singapore -> attracts immigrants to come work/live here -> Increased social-cultural diversity**

### Education system

* Many migrants come to Singapore for quality education either for themselves or for their children
* International students add to the diversity as they share their experiences and learning with their fellow students
* Singapore's education system is well recognized due to its high standards and effectiveness
* Many primary, secondary and junior colleges accept international students
* Tertiary institutions such as polytechnics and universities have been popular with international students
* They offer high standards of certification and a wide range of courses
* Example: MOE conducts an annual admissions exercise between September and October for international students who wish to join public schools
* Example: Singapore is a well known hub for quality education, attracting about 76,000 international students in 2017
* **Singapore's education system -> Foreigners can improve their social mobility and standard of living -> attracts immigrants to come work/live here -> Increased social-cultural diversity**
