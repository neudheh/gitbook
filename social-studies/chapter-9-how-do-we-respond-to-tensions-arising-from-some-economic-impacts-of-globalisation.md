# ðŸ“ˆ Chapter 9: How do we respond to tensions arising from some economic impacts of globalisation?

## Countries

### Economic growth

* Globalisation has increased trading and the expansion of businesses in different parts of the world
* Example: Foreign Direct Investment
  * FDI refers to investments in an Singaporean company by a company from another country
  * In 2017, the FDI in Singapore amounted to over $1,568 billion
* Example: Free trade agreements
  * FTAs are treaties between countries to establish a free trade are where the exchange of goods and services can be conducted without tariffs or hinderances -> substantial amount of tariff savings and increased trading between Singapore and partner countries
  * USA and Singapore signed an FTA which cam into force in 2004, which allowed the free trade of petrochemicals -> increased trade -> increased economic growth
* **Most countries have benefitted from an increased tax revenue and employment opportunities -> can improve country's infrastructure -> higher standard of living**
* **Trade becomes commonplace -> increased trading -> more wealth generated**
* **Population benefits too as there is a greater variety of good and services for consumption -> higher standard of living**

### Economic downturn

* In a global economy, when the economy of one country faces a downturn, it may affect other countries
* Recession in one country can lead to a domino effect in others
* Example: The 2008 Global Financial Crisis
  * The recession in US escalated to a global recession due to US's large role in international economics
  * Many banks internationally were force to close because their income was derived from investments in the US
* **In times of an economic downturn, a country may withdraw its investments or reduce its demand for goods and services from other countries -> Lesser income and employment for countries affected**

## Businesses

### Higher profits/ market share

* One way the MNCs can obtain higher profits/ higher market share is by setting up their operations in different locations -> Access to new markets abroad, lower labour costs and cheaper resources such as land and raw materials
* Example: Capitaland is an example of a Singaporean MNC that has successfully globalised and it is now present in 20 countries -> Can earn more from their real estate business
* Globalisation -> Increased market outreach -> Increase consumer pool -> more customers for their products -> higher profits
* Globalisation -> lower labour and resources costs -> don't have to pay as much for production -> higher profits

### Lower profits/ market share

* Alongside the MNCs are the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
* SMEs are important to Singapore's economy as they contribute more than 50% of economic output and 70% of employment
* MNCs are now competing with SMEs and bigger local companies, and many SMEs have found themselves that are unable to compete with larger companies that offer the same products and services
* SMEs need to constantly innovate and re invent itself -> invest into R\&D, but many SMEs may not have the capital to do so, while MNCs do -> outcompeted my MNCs -> forced to close
* SMEs face many challenges, like a small domestic market, a shortage of expertise and labour
* Example: In 2012, French Hypermarket chain, Carrefour closed its only branch in Singapore after 15 years due to competition from other companies offering similar products in Singapore (Proof that MNCs need to innovate too)
* **Globalisation -> increased competition from other companies -> harder to compete for a share of profits from the global economy**

## Individuals

### Higher income

* Globalisation has facilitated mobility, making it easier for individuals to look for jobs overseas
* Better job prospects and higher salaries for individuals
* These job prospects can be local and overseas
* Globalisation has led to this because with MNCs setting up companies overseas, locals in the host countries can have more employment opportunities and possible higher income if they are skilled
* Example: NTU engineers have been headhunted for jobs in Dubai and have gotten thrice the pay in Singapore with a less demanding lifestyle
* **Globalisation -> Mobility/MNCs setting up locally -> better job prospects -> higher income -> break out of the poverty cycle -> higher standard of living** &#x20;

### Loss in income

* Globalisation increases competition for jobs -> workers have to contend with lower income or risk losing their jobs due to companies having access to foreign markets offering lower labour costs
* Jobs may also be lost when global companies close down operations to shift to another location
* Workers may also lose their jobs because they are unable to equip themselves with the skills required for those jobs
* Example: Japanese fashion chain Uniqlo first started productions in Shenzhen, China, because of the low labour cost
  * However, when China's manufacturing and labour costs rose, it was no longer profitable for operations to be based there,&#x20;
  * So in 2013, Uniqlo moved out of China into Vietnam, where labour costs were half of China's
* **Loss of jobs -> Loss of income -> lower standard of living -> suffer**
