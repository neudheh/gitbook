# ðŸ§• Chapter 7: How can we respond in a diverse society?

## Management and impact of socio-cultural diversity

* Governments, like individuals can have different types of responses towards social-cultural diversity
* A government's response usually takes the form of policies that guide these immigrants on how they can be part of the host country
* Policies will attempt to assimilate or integrate the minority immigrant groups which could affect the interactions between the majority and minority groups in the country

### Assimilation (France)

* Assimilation is a policy when the government expects immigrants to adopt the beliefs and practices of the host country
* Supposed to make the identity of the immigrants indistinguishable from the majority groups in aspects such as cultural beliefs and practices
* In France, secularism is present in all areas of the state and no one's religion is to be favored over the other and so immigrants are expected to follow this belief
* &#x20;Example: Education
  * Strictly secular, and discussion of religion is allowed only in history and philosophy classes
  * Adaptation classes are conducted for children of immigrants to help improve their French and eventually join regular French schools which will help serve their assimilation into french society
* Example: Employment
  * Employment commits the immigrant to stay in the country, hastening his acquisition of social capital and French language for the purpose of communication
  * Hiring practises used to be discriminatory, but with the Diversity Charter, a greater diversity in the workplace was encourage which supports assimilation of immigrants
* Example: Naturalisation
  * Naturalisation helps immigrants develop basic knowledge about life in France and what being a French national means
  * All French immigrants are required to undergo French language courses and attend a day of civic education about French life before they are granted permanent residency
  * They are also expected to show knowledge of both French heritage and culture, French language proficiency  to be eligible for French nationality
* **When there are minimal differences and more things in common, such as a national identity, there are lesser chances of disagreement. Hence people form various groups get along â†’ Harmony**
* Tensions arising due to assimilation
  * Many new immigrants still hold onto their religious identities and this has caused challenges as the French believe that the national identity is threatened
  * Example: the 2004 law banning the display of religious items had Muslims and SIkh communities protesting through demonstrations to show their displeasure with the policy, saying it had violated the rights of individuals and freedom of religious expressions&#x20;
  * **Assimilation -> Loss of religious identities  -> Citizens feel resentment against the government -> political instability/ Citizens do not want to work with the government for the good of society and society cannot develop further**

### Integration (Singapore)

* Immigrants forge a common ground with the groups already living in the host country while the immigrants retain their unique identities
* Allow immigrants to retain their original identities while they adapt to the practises of the people living in the country
* Example: Naturalisation
  * The Singapore Citizenship e-journey is an online journey that allows new citizens to learn more about Singapore at their own pace and convenience, including information about our history and development of our society
  * This allows them to better understand how to fit into Singapore
* Example: Common experiences
  * Second-generation PRs are expected to dedicate 2 years of their lives to serving the nation despite not being native to Singapore
  * This thus encourages them to mix with people from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds and to put collective interest over oneself
* **More things in common, such as common experiences and identity such as a national identity, there are lesser chances of disagreement. Hence people form various groups get along â†’ Harmony**
* Tensions due to integration
  * Singaporeans have genrally been welcoming of new immigrants
  * Some singaporeans are unhappy because they feel that jobs and hob security have been taken away from Singaporeans with the arrival of new foreigners
  * The once strong singaporean identity has eroded with the arrival of large numbers of immigrants
  * **Integration -> Erosion of national identity -> Citizens feel resentment against the government -> political instability/ Citizens do not want to work with the government for the good of society and society cannot develop further**

## Management and impact of socio-economic diversity

* Citizens have rights and responsibilities
* Government is responsible for ensuring its citizens enjoy certain rights
* Every citizen has the right to receive healthcare services
* According to the World Health Organization, all people should be able to obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them
* Governments ensure this by helping where there is greater socio-economic diversity, e.g when the lower socio-economic groups are facing challenges from healthcare costs

### Market based approach

* Pricing of healthcare products is in the hands of businesses
* Quality of healthcare products and services is determined by businesses
* The role of citizens in choosing the appropriate healthcare is important
* CItizens may also purchase insurance from health insurance companies to help themselves afford healthcare services
* In US, businesses may pay for their employees' health insurance

#### Benefits

* Government
  * More resources for other societal needs such as defence (to ensure security) or economic goals (to ensure economic progress)
* Individuals
  * Liberty to choose the type of healthcare services and products -> Can choose better quality ones -> Get treated more efficiently -> Higher quality of life
  * When businesses earn money from market-based healthcare, they have the incentive to develop better products -> better healthcare in society -> increasing quality of life

#### Challenges

* Government
  * Citizens may feel that their basic needs are not being met -> tensions against the government as citizens feel resentment towards government -> political instability/ citizens do not want to work with the government for the good of society and society cannot develop further
* Individual
  * With little government intervention, individuals have to pay more out-of-pocket expenses for their healthcare needs
  * Increased financial burden on the individuals end
  * May not be able to afford the healthcare needs -> lower quality of life

### Shared responsibility approach

* Healthcare costs are shared between government and citizens
* Government pays for basic healthcare needs through subsidized and schemes
* Citizens pay part of the expenses (medisave account) -> pay for more premium healthcare, if needed

#### Benefits

* Government
  * Financial burden is not solely on the government, still have some resources for other societal needs
* Individuals
  * For low income families, more financial help will be given -> The do not have to pay so much for their healthcare needs -> get the treatment they need as they are now able to afford it -> higher quality of life
  * For middle to high income families, basic healthcare services is provided by the government, and they can top up fro premium services if they want to -> get treated more efficiently -> higher quality of life
  * Everybody, regardless of Socio-economic status is able to afford and have access to healthcare

#### Challenges

* Government
  * In an ageing population, healthcare services will be needed more as the elderly are more prone to illnesses -> may increase healthcare spending, decreasing resources for other societal needs -> society cannot progress
  * Singapore also has a growing population, increasing the strain on healthcare resources, decreasing resources for other societal needs -> society cannot progress

#### Solutions&#x20;

* Build more healthcare facilities
* Promote healthier lifestyles (campaigns) -> citizens adopt healthier lifestyle habits, will be less prone to illness -> lesser need for healthcare -> Decreased spending on healthcare

### Government-financed approach

* Most of healthcare needs is financed by the govt by collecting taxes from citizens
* Example: Sweden -> Very affordable healthcare due to high subsidies by the government

#### Benefits

* Citizens
  * Everyone, regardless of socio-economic status is able to afford the healthcare services they need -> Higher quality of life

#### Challenges

* Citizens
  * Especially for the lower income individuals, higher taxation rates will financially challenge them â†’ lesser money for other needs â†’ lower quality of life
* Government
  * Higher healthcare spending takes away resources from other societal needs -> society may not be able to develop&#x20;
  * Higher healthcare spending due to immigration in Sweden
