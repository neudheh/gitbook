# ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Chapter 2: How do we decide what is good for society?

## Challenges in deciding what is good for society

* Within a society there are challenges in deciding on what is good for society due to several reasons
  * Differing needs and interests
  * Differing priorities
  * Unequal sharing of costs

### Differing interests

* There would be differing needs and interests that may be rejected by society for the benefit of the common good
* Example: The government had to factor in the differing needs and interests of various groups, in particular the environmentalists and the majority of Singaporeans when deciding should the Cross-Island line cut through or skirt around the Central Catchment Nature reserve
* **This may result in conflicts and disagreements due to differing needs**
* **Affected groups may perceive that the government is being unfair towards them and unwilling to manage their needs and interests -> Will not support the government when decisions have to be made for the good of society**

### Differing priorities

* Citizens may agree that it is important for the country to provide affordable healthcare, a clean environment and good education. However, they may disagree on which area the government should prioritize
* Example: Parents with school-going children may want more resources to be invested in education. The elderly may prefer resources to be invested into healthcare to meet their medical needs
* **This may cause disagreement and unhappiness amongst the citizens when the government makes a decision that does not align with their priories**
* **Affected groups may perceive that the government is being unfair towards them and unwilling to manage their needs and interests -> Will not support the government when decisions have to be made for the good of society**

### Unequal sharing of costs

* When a decision is made, some individuals or groups will bear greater costs than others
* Example: For an efficient transportation system for the country, highways need to be built to ensure smooth traffic flow. Society will generally benefit from the building of the highway, but residents living near the highway may be affected by the noise generated from the traffic. They believe that these developments are needed, but also believe that they should be built further away from their homes so that they do not need to bear with the inconveniences associated with them
* **This may result in tension and unhappiness amongst the different groups of people in society**
* **Affected groups may perceive that the government is being unfair towards them and unwilling to manage their needs and interests -> Will not support the government when decisions have to be made for the good of society**

## Trade-offs

* A trade-off involves an exchange in which an individual has to decide between two or more things that cannot be obtained at the same time
* Resources are limited so the government must decided how to use the resources to benefit the most people
* The government has to consider our limited resources when making decisions to develop Singapore

_we are going to skip the part about the judiciary, the legislature and the executive because that shit is useless_

## How the government manages conflicting demands

### Leadership is key

* Having good leadership is significant in ensuring Singapore's continued success and survival because it will ensure stability in Singapore
* The leader must be honest and incorruptible, and capable of coming out with policies that meet the needs of society
* Example: One example of a good leader is Mr Lee Kwan Yew
* **Strong and good leaders -> Decisions made will put the interest of th**e **nation and its people first -> resources will not be wasted and be put to good use for the benefit of the people or for the country's progress**
* **Stability in Singapore -> will continue to attract investors and promote growth**

### Anticipating change and staying relevant

* Citizens' needs and interests are adversely affected in the short term due to a decision made based on more long term considerations, and tensions may arise
* Anticipating change and staying relevant helps Singapore to be prepared and forward-looking as we manage future challenges
* Example: The government decided to make Singapore self- sufficient in water supply by producing NEWater and desalinated water -> Ensure Singapore would stay self-sufficient and not be left vulnerable without water source
* **Strong foothold to overcome future challenges -> Can continue to survive in the world**

### Meritocracy - Reward for work, work for reward

* The principle of meritocracy refers to a system that distributes opportunities to enable future successes
* People are rewarded according to the effort they put in rather than factors such as their race, religion, or socio-economic background
* Example: Students who perform well in their studies and CCAs are rewarded in ways to help them excel further in the education. The Edusave Scholarship and Merit Bursary schemes reward the top 10 percent and 25 percent of students respectively
* **People are rewarded based on their effort and abilities -> encouraged to work hard**
* **Will feel valued -> contribute more the country -> Singapore progresses**

### Stake for everyone, opportunities for all

* Providing a stake for everyone allows the people in Singapore to be involved in decision-making and increase citizens sense of belonging
* They would feel that they have a stake in Singapore's future and be more willing to be involved in working towards the good of society
* Example: The Our Singapore Conversation in 2012 was where Singapore shared their views, hopes and dreams about Singapore. The government was able to learn about Singaporeans' hopes and desires and these ideas shared by Singaporeans have helped chart future plans for Singapore
* **Greater sense of belonging in citizens -> Feel they have a stake in Singapore's future -> more willing to be involved in working for the good of society**
* **Sense of belonging and rootedness to Singapore -> Contribute more to the country -> Singapore progresses**
