# ðŸ‘³â™‚ Chapter 6: What are the experiences and effects of living in a diverse society?

## Interactions in a diverse society

* As societies become increasingly diverse, it is essential to ensure harmonious interactions
* For this to occur, there must be a willingness to live together and build harmony in society
* Immigration has led to a diverse population, meaning more opportunities for cultural exchanges between residents and non-residents, enriching learning and understanding of each other&#x20;
* Common space refers to a physical space, shared values and common experiences that build out national identity
* It provides opportunities for people of different nationalities, races and ethnicities, religions and socio-economic status to come together to work, play and live together
* They provide a conducive environment for interaction to take place
* The people's association (PA) is a statutory board established on 1 July 1960 to promote racial harmony and social cohesion, and to act as a bridge between the government and people
  * The PA creates common space by offering a wide range of community programs and volunteering opportunities for Singaporeans of all walks of life

## Exchange and appreciation in a diverse society

### Culture

* Cultural exchanges can create distinct experiences because of diversity in nationality, race and ethnicity, religion and socio-economic status
* Our diverse society provides people with many opportunities to interact and learn from those who hail from different countries and cultures
* This can result in fusion between local cultures and foreign ideas, which can result in interesting outcomes, as seen in areas such as food, fashion, and music
* Example: Chef Willin Low has created fusions between Singapore and modern European dining, such as soft shell chili crab with squid ink mantou, laksa pesto linguini and char siew pork burgers
* **Diversity â†’ More exposure to various cultural elementsâ†’ More appreciation and understanding of different culturesâ†’Lesser misconceptions and negative assumption about othersâ†’ Positive interactionsâ†’ Harmony, Social stability in a diverse society**

### Skills and knowledge

* The transfer of skills and knowledge can happen when people of diverse backgrounds come to study and work together
* Exchange of skills and knowledge levels up competencies of local workers causing the development of country or people to boost the economy
* Example: The Biomedical Research Council (BMRC) actively supports and funds scientific collaborations between foreign experts and Singaporean scientists; one positive outcome was the discovery of the H1N1 flu vaccine.
* **Diversity â†’ Collaboration between local and foreign workers â†’ Exchange of skills and Knowledge â†’  Local workers are able to adopt skills and knowledgeâ†’ Increased work efficiency â†’ Business growthâ†’ Singapore economic growth**

## Prejudice and misconceptions

* Stereotypes are a belief held by one social group about another social group
* Some of these stereotypes can be negative and known as prejudices which are negative conclusions about people
* Prejudice can arise due to misconceptions about nationality, race and ethnicity, religion or socio-economic status
* Prejudice is dangerous and can create an environment where discrimination can happen more often
* Such prejudice and misconceptions would lead to misunderstandings/ erroneous assumptions/ discrimination between groups of people in the country
* This would then harm the relationships in the country/ threat the social fabric of the country -> Disharmony
* Example: In 2012, A chinese university student referred to Singaporeans as dogs, sparking much debate on social media bout the prejudices  of various nationalities
* **Prejudice and misconceptions  -> Misunderstandings -> Tensions in a divers society -> Disharmony in societies/ Social instability**

## Competition for resources

### Standard of living

* With the influx of foreigners, Singaporeans have expressed concerns over issues such as unemployment, housing, transportation and the rise in prices of goods and services
* Some Singaporeans believe that the influx of foreign workers has resulted in lower wages for lower skills because foreign workers are willing to work for lower salaries
* Another concern that affected SIngaporeans was in the areas of living space and infrastructure
* There were concerns about  public transportation becoming more crowded, how beds were not available for patients who need to be admitted to the hospital and rising housing costs
* The government identified needs in terms of quality urban spaces, convenient access to amenities, integrated transport modes and services
* Example: The filipino community was harassed online when they revealed plans to celebrate Philippines independence day at Orchard Road&#x20;
* **Concerns over standard of living -> Misunderstandings/ Misplaced blame on foreigners -> tensions in a diverse society -> Singapore loses its attraction for foreigners -> Lesser contribution by foreigners -> lower economic development in Singapore**

### Social mobility

* As income gaps between the lower and higher income groups has increase over the years in SIngapore, this has led to many singaporeans feeling that social mobility is being limited
* One issue that could be affecting the income gap would be outsourcing issues
* Lower skilled Singaporeans have found it difficult to get jobs in Singapore because jobs that require such skulls have moved to other countries in the region, which offer lower labour costs
* **Concerns over social mobility-> Misunderstandings/ Misplaced blame on foreigners -> tensions in a diverse society -> Singapore loses its attraction for foreigners -> Lesser contribution by foreigners -> lower economic development in Singapore**

#### Solutions

* Education
  * Meritocracy allows all students regardless of socio-economic status and opportunity to achieve their best and excel at what they are good at
  * These opportunities are critical to ensure that Singaporeans are not denied opportunities due to their financial circumstance&#x20;
* Re-training and learning of new skills
  * This enables a lower income group to stay relevant to economic demands -> improves their social mobility
  * This also can be done through upholding the principle of meritocracy
