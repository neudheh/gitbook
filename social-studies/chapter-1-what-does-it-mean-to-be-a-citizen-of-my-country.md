* Countries usually include the rights of citizens as part of the constitution
* Rights are liberties that citizens in a country have that are protected by the law
* A constitution that specifies the rights of citizens would help a country protect the well-bring of its citizens, and ensures that these rights are respected by the law and by everyone in the country

### Responsibilities of citizens

* As citizens, we have responsibilities to fulfill
* We fulfill these responsibilities also because we are connected to other members in the community or society

* Different countries have different responsibilities
* **As citizens, we have a responsibility to participate towards meaningful causes which will contribute towards the good of the county â†’ progress and prosperity, and build a harmonious Singapore to advance the well-being of other Singaporeans**

## Citizenship shaped by identity

* Citizens may also feel a sense of belonging to the country
* This identity creates the desire to be involved in the affairs of the country and make it a better place to live in
* Comes from the shared belief that we belong to the same country
* This shared belief is from sharing aspects of a common way of life
* Example: Singing the national anthem, celebrating national day
* Example: Singaporeans also feel proud that the country is known as a food haven to others; Singaporeans and tourists are able to find a wide variety of food across the country
* **We feel close to other Singaporeans as there is a common identity -> Strengthens sense of identity -> feels that he/she belongs to this country -> willingness to care for others and improve society**&#x20;

## Citizenship shaped by participation

* Public affairs refer to issues that are of general interest or concern to most people in society
* Citizens can contribute towards the good of society either as individuals or through organized groups
* Contribute in areas they are passionate about
* Example: Our Singapore Conversation in 2012 to obtain feedback from citizens; many citizens from all walks of life gave feedback and suggestions for improvement in Singapore
* **Greater ownership and commitment towards the causes they are involved in -> feel belonged as there is a common purpose -> want to make country a better place to live in**
