## Simple inference <a href="#h.cy05bpw4i1h2" id="h.cy05bpw4i1h2"></a>

* “What”/”Infer”/”Learn”
* Point, Evidence, Explanations - use the inquiry question to help you

## Inference with purpose <a href="#h.hgefpt4na492" id="h.hgefpt4na492"></a>

* “Why”/”Purpose”/”Motive”/”Agenda”
* Message, Impact
* SIAPEEO (Speaker, Intent, audience, point, evidence,explanation, outcome)

## Comparison <a href="#h.mcay7wlp0q02" id="h.mcay7wlp0q02"></a>

* Similar/ Different/ Agree/ Disagree ← Use keywords, if not 0
* Content comparison (direct one answer to the inquiry question)
* Similarity and difference in content
* Higher level - attitude and purpose (but can afford to lose this mark if no time)

| Attitude                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Reliability/ Utility/ Proving <a href="#h.6e685p2x3plq" id="h.6e685p2x3plq"></a>

* Believe/ accept/ reliable/ prove/ useful
* Content - Reliable/ Useful
* Proving question - Determine if it proves/ does not prove
* Check reliability → Cross reference and Critical Analysis
* Cross Reference - Make sure your points match the content paragraph
* Critical Analysis - POOH (Positive/ Negative, Objective/ Subjective, Organisation, Hidden agenda) ← Don’t do this for history, use context + purpose

## Surprised <a href="#h.jmophh3ogjne" id="h.jmophh3ogjne"></a>

* Content + CR → Different/ Similar → Surprised or not
* CA → Expected (Content/ purpose) vs reality
* Check if it goes against your understanding

## Hybrid 1 - 2 Sources proving <a href="#h.p067rkqlyshb" id="h.p067rkqlyshb"></a>

Does source E prove Source D wrong

* Focus source (Does Source E prove that Source F is correct?)
* Content comparison → Similar/ different → ATQ
* Check reliability of focus source through CR and/ or CA → Reliable/ not reliable → Prove or not&#x20;
* CA → reliable/ not reliable → prove or not

## Hybrid 2 -  2 Surprised <a href="#h.ggivdi6n9rmm" id="h.ggivdi6n9rmm"></a>

* Content comparison → Similar/ different → ATQ
* CA of both sources → Reasons behind messages of both sources (Context/ Purpose)
* Generally not surprised

## Hybrid 3 - 2 sources utility <a href="#h.ld4fmzk4sjr8" id="h.ld4fmzk4sjr8"></a>

Which source is more useful as evidence for \_\_\_

* Plan out your paragraphs
* See which source is more reliable
* 1st para: More reliable source content + CR + CA
* 2nd para: Other source content + CA

## Study all sources <a href="#h.vjlqpvefas80" id="h.vjlqpvefas80"></a>

* Reasons/ Factor question
* Reasons → Biassed/ one sided statement → WHY???
* Factor → factors/ agents → What are the other factors?
* Unpack the question and FOQ
* Example: Individuals should be responsible for tackling haze in singapore
* Factor Question → Individuals/ government/ Businesses
* FOQ - tackling haze in singapore
* Significance → Lower air pollution, people healthier, lead normal lives
* Example: Preventive measures are most important in managing terrorism
* Factor Question → Preventive measures/
* FOQ → managing terrorism
* Significance → safe country, peace, not at risk of being vulnerable to attacks, aggressors don’t attack → confidence in the country
* Table → categorise source under
* Agree /disagree
* PEOS
* Ask yourself so what 3 times for O and S
* \+2 Marks → reliability/ contextual  knowledge/ balanced conclusion
