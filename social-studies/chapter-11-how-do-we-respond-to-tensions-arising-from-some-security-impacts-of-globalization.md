# 💣 Chapter 11: How do we respond to tensions arising from some security impacts of globalization?

## Cybersecurity challenges

* Advancements in technology have led to the growth of online computer networks which store huge amounts of confidential data
* Globalization has made it easier for people to access information virtually
* However, computer networks, programs and information have become more vulnerable to cyber attacks
* This challenge to cybersecurity is global in nature as attacks can come from any part of the world

### Impacts

#### Governments

* Cyber-criminals use malware to infect computer networks, which allow them to access the information inside the networks
* Some cyber-criminals attack government networks to gain access to secret information concerning a country or dealings between countries
* If cyber-attacks are targeted at critical infrastructure, it could create a widespread crisis and make the country vulnerable to such attacks
* Example: Wikileaks is an organization that publishes on the internet secret information that is gathered from documents, emails and recordings from government, companies and political parties
  * Some of their new leaks include US military operation in Afghanistan and operation details of how the US military dealt with prisoners in the Guantanamo Bay Military Prison
* **Hackers obtain sensitive information (military secrets)/ create trouble for the country as a whole -> impact a country's reputation, and relations with its neighbors -> create a widespread crisis as countries/ individuals/ groups may take offense/ pick on the operation's details**

#### Businesses

* Cyber-criminals hack into businesses' networks to steal trade secrets or money
* Rival companies can then sue this information to stay competitive
* Financial institutions such as banks are often targets because hackers can steal vast amounts of money if they can successfully hack into an online banking network
* Example: (example not from textbook, please trust me) Hacking group Lapsus$ hacked many large corporations in 2022, including Microsoft, Nvidia and Samsung, releasing source code of their services and products and employee credentials
* **Hackers expose sensitive information -> Rival companies can sue this information to stay competitive -> increased competition -> harder to compete for a share of profits in a global economy**

#### Individuals

* Criminals can use malware to steal the information that individuals places online through computers or smartphones and use the information against individuals in various ways (e.g. blackmail)
* Can launch a cyber attack against individuals by using our online identities
* Example: (example not from textbook, please trust me) In 2018, SingHealth had a cyber attack, where the personal information for 1.5 million patients, including PM lee were stolen, making it Singapore's worst cyber attack
* **Hackers obtain sensitive information -> launch cyber attacks against individuals -> peace and security is threatened -> instability**

### Management

* As a result, there is a growing need to manage cybersecurity risks
* Cyber-criminals can operate from any part of the world, which makes managing these risks especially hard
* The strengthening of cyber defenses is a natural counter to cyber attacks through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a system

#### Government

* Example: National cyber security masterplan 2018 to further secure Singapore's cybersecurity environment focuses on
  * Growing Singapore's pool of cybersecurity experts
  * Enhancing security of cybersecurity infrastructure
  * Increasing efforts to promote the adoption of cyber security measures among businesses and individuals
  * **Ensured cyber-security -> reduced vulnerability to cyber attacks -> deters potential aggression from attacking Singapore -> Creates a sense of order and security/ no chaos/ peace and security/ national security is not threatened -> stability within the country**

#### Individuals

* Example: Install, maintain and update antivirus software and firewalls to prevent malware infections
* Example: Create strong passwords and enable 2-Factor authentication
* Example: Be careful about searching habits and never open suspicious-looking emails
* Example: Use your browser's privacy tools
* **Ensured own cyber-security -> reduced vulnerability to cyber attacks -> deters potential aggression from attacking Singapore -> Creates a sense of order and security/ no chaos/ peace and security/ national security is not threatened -> stability within the country**

## Transnational Terrorism

* Transnational terrorism is when the operations and impacts of terrorism involve many countries
* Threats can come within and beyond a country's borders
* Intensified due to advancements in technology -> Easier to coordinate operations across countries, online or in person
* Advancements in technology -> use of internet to spread their violent beliefs to a global audience -> recruit, train, raise money, transfer funds, collect intelligence and distribute propaganda
* Example: 9/11 attacks on the 11th of September, when Al-Qaeda hijacked four American aeroplanes and crashed them into various locations in the USA such as the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington DC, killing 19 terrorists and nearly 3000 other people in just 80 minutes
* **Transnational terrorism -> Loss of many lives -> atmosphere of fear -> Disharmony**

Or

* **Transnational terrorism -> destruction of property and loss of workers -> economy affected**

### Self-radicalization

* Self-radicalised individuals or _"lone wolfs"_ refer to individuals who are not members  of any terrorist group, but have been inspired and radicalised by extremist propaganda, usually by what they have read on social media and the internet
* Example: In 2013, there was a self-radicalised female infant car teacher for PCF Sparkletots who was detained under the ICA for pro-ISIS activities
* **Self-radicalisation ->Terrorism -> loss of many lives -> atmosphere of fear -> disharmony**
* **Self-radicalisation -> Terrorism -> Destruction of property and loss of workers -> economy affected**

### Management

#### Preventive

* Preventive measures are important because they can prevent terrorist attacks
* Act as a form of deterrence
* Example: Border controls help prevent movements of known or suspected terrorists as well as materials that can produce explosive through land, sea and air checkpoint
  * Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) implemented biometric passports that have biological data, making it difficult for terrorists to enter countries using forged passports
  * **Higher risk of being discovered and caught before they can conduct their terrorist activities -> deters terrorists -> prevent terrorists from smuggling  materials used to produce explosives into the country**
* Countries realised that preventive measures are only effective if they work together and that no individual country can fight the global nature of terrorism on its own
* Example: Singapore collaborate with other countries in ASEAN to fight against transnational terrorism through various platforms such as the ASEAN Counter-Terrorism workshops where countries exchange best practices so as to enhance counter-terrorism cooperation in the region
  * **Collaboration between countries -> Countries pool together resources to combat terrorism -> easier to track and monitor activities of terrorists -> increase chances of thwarting their plans to hurt civilians and bring destruction to the country -> stop and prevent unnecessary loss of lives**
* Example: Total defence helps Singapore to build a strong, secure and cohesive country that is prepared to deal with any crisis or security challenges, including transnational terrorism
  * **Total defence -> reduced vulnerability to terrorists attacks -> not so bold to carry out their attacks -> cannot deal maximum damage to the country and its people**

#### Protective

* Work hand-in-hand with preventive measures
* Surveillance through CCTV and security checks/screening
* Example: Surveillance increased at infrastructure like power stations and public places with large numbers of people like Changi Airport because they are perceived to be more vulnerable to attacks by terrorists
  * The RSAF works closely with CAAS to protect Singapore's airspace
  * **Terrorists know that surveillance is enhanced in such places and on such people -> not so bold to carry out their attacks -> cannot deal maximum damage to the country and its people**

#### Responsive

* Governments must also be prepared with responsive measures, in case terrorist attacks do occur to deal with damages or ham brought about by such acts
* Example: Frequent exercises are held by the SPF and the SCDF to test their contingency plans for acts of terrorism
  * Exercise **** Heartbeat is held annually where Home Team agencies work with the community and private organisations
* **Better prepared to deal with a range of security threats and enhanced resilience to stand united and recover quickly after an incident -> Singapore has the means to respond swiftly and calmly when terrorist attacks actually happen -> hinder attacker's objectives of creating chaos and striking fear in the people**&#x20;
