# ðŸŒŽ Chapter 8: What does it mean to live in a globalized world?

## What is globalisation?

* Globalisation is the process through which people's ideas and activities in different parts of the world become more interconnected
* This can make the world feel like it has become smaller or has shrunk

## Driving forces of globalisation

### Developments in transportation

* The world seems to have "shrunk" in terms of the time needed to get from one place to another
* This is achieved through&#x20;
  * improvements in the size and speed of different modes of transportation
  * development of efficient and integrated transportation infrastructures such as airports, seaports and railways
* Example: The capacity of air transportation has increased from just one passenger in 1903 to 853 passengers now in the present
* **Developments in transportation -> Savings in transport cost -> goods and people can be moved around the world more quickly and at a lower cost -> Facilitates the process through which people's ideas and activities become interconnected**

### Growth of MNCs

* MNCs are worldwide operations coordinated and controlled by the headquarters which is usually located in a developed country
* They operate in a number of countries and have production or service facilities outside of their country of origin
* These companies also seek out components and materials from all over the world before assembling the final product yet in another country
* Example:  The Starbucks coffee company which is the largest coffee chain in the world today with operations spanning over 65 countries
* **Growth of MNCs -> MNCs setting up companies in other parts of the world and linking them to the parent company at home -> people and their activites become interconnected -> economies become more integrated/interconnects**

### Advancements in technology

* Technological advancements in communication has resulted in greater access to the internet and the increasing use of mobile communication -> communications among people are faster and more convenient
* These allow information to be relayed from one end of the world to the other at a very high speed, resulting in a rise in the exchange of information globally&#x20;
* Example: The invention of the smartphone in the 21st century has allowed people to connect and communicate through messaging and video calls, as well as gain access to a vast amount of information over the internet
* **Advances in technology -> faster and more convenient communication -> information can be relayed at high speeds -> rise in the exchange of information -> ideas and activities become interconnected**
