# ðŸª– Stalin

## Reasons for the Rise of Stalin

### Favourable circumstances

#### Non-disclosure of Lenin's testament

* In the days leading up to Lenin's death, Lenin became suspicious of Stalin's character and ambitions
  * He made his views about Stalin known in his testament, which also had criticisms of the other leading successors
  * Lenin was especially clear about removing Stalin from his role as the Secretary-General of the Communist party
* When Lenin died in 1924, his testament was read out at the meeting of the Central Executive committee, where all of his potential successors were present
  * They agreed to not make the testament public, as Lenin had criticized all of them
  * No notes were made when it was read out and no mention of it was to be made in future meetings
* Some party members felt the Trotsky was a greater threat due to his powerful personality and close connection to the army
* They decided to ignore Lenin's warning
* **Stalin kept his position as Secretary-General -> Kept control over party organization -> Can carry out his manipulations and further reduces Trotsky's power base -> Rise to power**

#### **Trotsky's unpopularity in the politburo**

* Trotsky's was Lenin's right hand man and the head of the red army, whom he had the support of as he led them to victory in the Russian Civil war
  * Very powerful, making him the biggest threat to others in the politburo, making him unpopular
* Was very outspoken and argued with Lenin on several topics
  * Had a lot of material enemies could use to attack him
  * E.g. He had criticized Lenin's New Economic Policy along with other policies
  * Enemies had plenty of material to attack him and accuse him of disloyalty to the party
* Believed in Permanent revolution, and sought to promote and incite communist revolutions all over the world
  * Stalin argued for socialism in one country, strengthening the Soviet Union before moving on to other countries
  * Stalin made sure that the party members supported him, and made it seem that Trotsky was moving away from the party's decisions and ideas
* Around Lenin's death, he fell very ill, and was too weak to organise his own supporters
* **Gradually sidelined within the party and was in a position where he could be voted off -> removal of trotsky as a rival -> rise to power**

### **Stalin's manipulations**

#### Pretended to be close to Lenin

* Frequently visited Lenin
* Gave party members and the public the impression that Lenin favoured and trusted Stalin
* After Lenin died of a heart attack in 1924, Stalin organised Lenin's funeral, making it a grand affair
* Ordered Lenin's body to be embalmed and displayed in a mausoleum in the Red Square in Moscow
* Gave the funeral speech and established himself as the chief mourner, showing himself deeply sorrowful over the loss of Lenin
* Ordered for the city of Petrograd to be renamed to Leningrad
* Kept Trotsky form attending Lenin's funeral by giving him the wrong date
* To the Russians, Stalin was the natural successor to Lenin

#### Control over Party organization

* Stalin was made Secretary-General of the communist party, giving him the authority to appoint and re-assign party members
* Able to replace allies of his opponents with his own allies
* Gained control of the Cheka
* Many key party officials owed their position to him and were loyal to him
* Controlled the Central Executive Committee and spread his influence among the local party committees
* **Had a strong support base -> Influence many communist party members to support him -> rise to power**
* **Trotsky's support base shrank considerably -> Forced to resign -> Rise to power**

#### Exploitation of ideological divisions

* Members of the communist party were divided between the moderates and the radicals
  * Moderates followed Lenin's leadership and ideology closely
  * Radicals formed new ideas and challenged the system
* Stalin took advantage of the ideological divisions in the party
* Joined Zinoviev and Kamenev in a Troika alliance and advocated for socialism in one country against Trotsky's permanent revolution, and discredited his ideas
  * Attacked and ruined Trotsky's reputation, making seem like a traitor
  * Removed from his position as Chief of red army and expelled from communist party
* Allied with Bukharin Tomsky and Rykov to discredit Zinoviev and Kamenev
  * Discredited them and removed them form the party
* Attacked Bukharin and Rykov, discrediting them and removing them from the party
* **Allowed Stalin to eliminate contenders in the power struggle -> Cleared the path for him to rise to power**

## Economic impact

* Stalin sought to modernise the Soviet Union and achieve the same economic and military levels as the western powers
* He attempted to achieve this through a series of Five-Year Plans, setting targets for industrial and agricultural development for each plan
* Rapid industrialisation and collectivisation were to work hand in hand

### Collectivisation

* Stalin sought to merge the small individual farms of the soviet union into larger collective farms
* It was believed that larger units of land could be farmed more efficiently through mechanisation, such as the use of tractors
* It was a complete reversal from the previous economic policy, Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP), in terms of its aims and measured
* By 1935, almost all the farms in the Soviet Union were kolkhozy (collective farms)

#### Aims

* To be more in line with the Party's motto of 'Peace, Land and Bread' for all, rather than private land ownership (i.e. all land under state control, no one can profit, USSR becomes truly communist)
* To aid Stalin's main aim of rapid industrialisation
* To promise a secure food supply for factory workers
* To export crops to other countries to raise funds for industrialisation
* To make farming more efficient and allow farmers to become factory workers, as lesser farmers are needed due to mechanisation

#### Measures

* Land was owned by the state
* Crops are distributed by the state
* The quantities of crops that farmers had to produce, as well as their working hours and wages were fixed by the state
* Equipment, such as tractors, for farmers to work with were provided by the state
* Farmers who produced low quantities or were absent from work were punished
* Shock workers, who were made to be model urban workers and farmers, were used to force peasants to join collective farms and remove kulaks

#### Results

* Social
  * Will be covered in depth in [#social-impact](stalin.md#social-impact "mention")
  * Many peasants, especially the kulaks, killed their own animals and burnt their grain and produce, and hid or buried their crops in the ground to prevent them from being taken over by the state
  * Bad harvest contributed to the Great Famine of 1932-1933, which led to the deaths of millions of peasants in parts of the Soviet Union&#x20;
* Economic (-ve)
  * Grain harvest dropped dramatically between 1931- 1934 and did not recover to their 1928 level
  * Loss of animal population (cattle, pigs and sheep) were not recovered until after WWII in 1945
  * **Drop in agricultural production -> Did not meet original meet the original objectives of increasing agricultural yield, aggravated the problem instead -> Failure**
* Economic (+ve)
  * The state managed to collect the grain it needed to feed the industrial towns and export them to buy industrial equipments
  * Manpower for new factories were found as peasants left the countryside
  * **Had enough grain to feed workers / could buy industrial machinery / more workers for industrialisation -> USSR became a great industrial nation in the 1930s and by 1940, had overtaken Britain, a leading industrial country in iron and steel production**
  * **Helped the USSR during WWII as it had created an industrial base from which the USSR could build enough amendments to help the USSR fight germany and emerge from the war a superpower**
  * **Transformed USSR fro a backwards agricultural society to ti a modernise thate that could compete with the west -> Ensured USSR's status as a superpower -> Success**
* Political (+ve)
  * **Collectivization ->Removal of NEP -> No private ownership of land/ no one can profit -> No more Kulaks -> USSR became more aligned with communism -> Had full control over the countryside**

### Industrialisation

* Factories in the cities would produce equipment for the mechanisation of farming, such as tractors
* With such equipment, fewer farm workers would be needed and could go into the cities to be factory workers
* More grain and other crops could be produced
* These larger, more efficient and mechanised farms owned by the state could then be able to produce more food to supply the cities and the factories
* Emphasis was placed on the development of heavy industries such as iron, steel and electricity
* Hundreds of new factories were built, and the industrial workforce expanded
* Quotas were set for producing such machinery and other factory goods, and working hours and wages were fixed

#### The  five-year plans

* 1st FYP:
  * 1928-1932
  * Emphasized heavy industries such as coal, iron, steel and oil
  * Targets set by the government were unrealistic, but the results were remarkable
  * Tremendous increase in output in all areas
  * More than 1500 industrial plants and more than 100 new industrial cities
* 2nd FYP:
  * 1933-1937
  * Gave priority to heavy industries
  * Emphasis was also given to transport
  * The road, railway and canal networks improve tremendously during this period
* 3rd FYP
  * 1938-1942
  * Interrupted by WWII
  * All of the country's resources were put into the war industry to develop weapons to defeat the Germans
  * 'Luxuries' such as bicycles and radios

#### Outcome

* Economic (Positive)
  * Outputs in coal, iron, steel and saw significant increases
  * During the great depression, there was full employment in the USSR, unlike the millions of unemployed people in western countries
  * Moscow now had broad roads, impressive concrete buildings, and a subway train station with marbled stations
  * **USSR became a great industrial nation in the 1930s and by 1940, had overtaken Britain, a leading industrial country in iron and steel production**
  * **Helped the USSR during WWII as it had created an industrial base from which the USSR could build enough amendments to help the USSR fight germany and emerge from the war a superpower**
  * **Transformed USSR fro a backwards agricultural society to to a modernise state that could compete with the west -> Ensured USSR's status as a superpower -> Success**
* Social (Negative)
  * Covered in [#social-impact](stalin.md#social-impact "mention")

## Political impact

### The Great Terror (1934-1938)

* Stalin instilled fear in the people's lives to gain absolute control over the country

#### Show trials and purges

* Stalin organised the show trials to establish opponents and stay in power
  * His main aim in organising the show trial was  to establish complete control over the communist party, and to eliminate any potential threats
  * Prominent leaders such as Kamenev, ZInoviev and Bukharin were tried in public show trials, confessed to crimes they didn't commit, and executed
  * Many others soon followed, and they only confessed to crimes they didn't commit after having being tortured or having their families threatened
* Stalin was also suspicious of the Red Army, as Trotsky led them to victory in the Russian Civil War, and had respect and confidence in him
  * High-ranking commands and tens of thousands of Red Army officers were arrested and shot or sent to Labour camps
  * Stalin mostly promoted younger, inexperienced members of the Party who owed their advancement and allegiance to him alone
  * He could be assured of the loyalty of the army and that commanders and officers would not rise up against him
* **Stalin had absolute authority over the communist party and led to the creation of a dictatorship -> Russians were subjected to a repressive rule under Stalin -> Stalin became too powerful and no one dared to oppose or challenge him**

#### Arrests and interrogations

* The secret police arrested, questioned and forced people to inform against their friends and family who voiced opposition against Stalin
* Anyone could be arrested as an opposer
* Peasants, factory workers, intellectuals (scientists, teachers and writer) were arrested to prevent them form gaining opposition to stalin's rule, and were killed or send to labour camps
* People were encouraged to inform on fellow workers, neighbours or even their own family members, who mentioned anything against Stalin or the state
* 20 million russians were victims of Stalin's purges
* **Created atmosphere of fear and suspicion that came at a very high human cost -> Russians were under totalitarian rule -> Stalin became too powerful and no one dared to oppose or challenge him**
* Loss of intellectuals/ skilled workers and professionals -> Loss of vital workers for the industrial FYP -> Factories produced poor quality goods/ faulty bridges and dams
* Loss of admins at a time when state control was expanding -> Less effective management within the government&#x20;
* Loss or red army officer and commanders -> No strong leadership for the inexperienced soldiers -> affected ability to prepare for WWII

### Propaganda

* Stalin also used  propaganda to portray himself as the legitimate successor to Lenin and to manipulate popular opinion for his policies
* Used to justify his authoritarian regime
* Claimed to be a father to the people
* Loyal or intimidated artists praised the leader in films, books, posters, paintings and musicals, giving rise to a new form of art called soviet realism
* Stalinist propaganda was everywhere, all offices, factories and classrooms were required to have a picture of stalin
* Photographs and pieces of history were edited to depict him as the hero of the revolution
* Propaganda indoctrinated the people and conditioning them to believe that he was infallible and god-like, working towards the best interests of the people
* Used his cult of personality to ensure loyalty and worship to his rule to quell criticism and use lies in media to justify his actions
* **Propaganda -> Could manipulate public opinion to support him in his policies and even justified his reign of terror   -> Indoctrinated russians to follow his lead during the reign -> Could bend the will of russians to his desire and turn a blind eye to his atrocities during his rule and continue to support his harsh regime**

## Social impact

### Fall in standard of living

* The drive for industrialisation cause more people to move to the cities where the factories where located
* The increasing population in the cities intensified the problem of housing shortage
* Many people were forced to live in cramped conditions without running water or sanitation, in over crowded cities
* Workers were also pushed very hard in order to meet the ambitious targets set out by the five year plans
* They worked long hours, with little time off, in poor conditions
* The welfare of workers was often ignored in the drive to meet overall industrial targets, and there was little or no access to consumer goods, which was not a priority in Stalin's drive to meet the targets
* 3rd FYP falsely promised luxuries like raidos and bicycles, but was interrupted when WWII began, causing industries to shift towards the production of weaponry and resources
* **Industrialization -> Fall in standard of living -> High human cost -> Failure**

### Famine

* Many peasants, especially the kulaks killed their own animals, burnt their own grain or produce, and hid or buried their crops in the ground to prevent them from being taken over by the state
* There was such heavy resistance, Stalin temporarily abandoned collectivization in 1929
* A bad harvest contributed to the great famine of 1932-1933, causing the death of 7 million peasants
* **Collectivisation -> Famine -> High human cost -> Failure**

### Living in fear

* The secret police had informers everywhere, and the slightest indication of any anti-Stalin sentiments could warrant an arrest
* People knew they were constantly being watched and judged by Stalin's officials
* If they were judged poorly, it would be more difficult for them to apply for housing, jobs or holidays
* If they stood out for the wrong reasons, or upset officials, they may be arrested and killed or sent to forced labour camps
* **Arrests and interrogations -> Atmosphere of fear and suspicion that came at a very high human cost -> Russians live in fear under brutal totalitarian rule**

### Minority nationalities

* The various minority republics of the former russian empire lost their autonomy with the creation of the USSR
* The USSR was a one-party state, with powers in the the hands of Stalin and the communist party in Moscow
* The minority republics were allowed to use their own languages, and were governed by their own governments, but these governments were appointed and controlled by Moscow
* Stalin believed that modernisation and industrialisation where more important than cultural traditions despite coming from a minority background
* He envisioned all people in the USSR working towards the common goals of collectivisation and industrialisation
* The same effects the USSR felt under Stalin's policies were also felt in the minority republics
* Many member of nationalist groups in these minority republics which advocated autonomy for themselves were among those targeted in the Great Terror

### The New Soviet Man

* In building up the USSR to be a great nation, Stalin did not just focus on modernisation
* He launched the Cultural Revolution from 1929-1931 to attack the intellectuals, the privileged class, religious leaders and artists to move the USSR to a more proletarian society with proletarian values
* Within this revolution was the creation of the 'New Soviet Man", the ideal soviet citizen who was proud of being part of the modern industrial society, and willing to serve the state selflessly and enthusiastically
* The Stakhanovites, named after Alexey Stakhanov, were supposedly ordinary people such as factory workers, miners or teachers, but many had some connection with the party
* Their achievements were upheld, and this initially spurred more to exceed their industrial targets, and Stakhanovites were publicly hailed as heroes
* However, the pressure to perform up the states standard, and the oppression against those who failed to do so left many pessimistic and disgruntled with the FYP

### Women

* Russia legalised abortion and divorce so that women could have control over their own lives without interference form their husbands
* Stalin's industrialisation efforts encouraged women to enter the workforce and become productive members of the economy
* State-run childcare centres were built to enable women to work in the factories, but they were poorly maintained
* In 1936, abortion was made illegal again to protect motherhoods and childhood, thus soviet women were expected to fulfill the roles of worker and housewife

### Compulsory schooling

* School attendance was compulsory, and every child was entitled to at least 9 years of free education
* But it was loaded with propaganda and emphasized communism and atheism
* Before the revolution only 4% of males aged 40-9 could read, but by 1939, this has risen to 94%, and for women it rose from 13% to 65%
* Schools and universities also emphasized technical subjects that would help meet national industrialization targets
* Teenagers were encouraged to join the Komsomol, which took them on outdoor activities and indoctrinated to be loyal to Stalin and the Party
* They were later promoted to prominent party posts by Stalin as he eliminated his opposition
* Children aged 10-15 were encouraged to join the young Pioneers, where they were sent out across the USSR to work on political campaigns or on collective farms and industries
