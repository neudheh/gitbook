# ðŸŒŽ Origins of the cold war

## Wartime tensions

### Ideological differences

* With the defeat of Japan in July 1945, the USA and the USSR emerged as the two superpowers, both championing different ideologies of democracy and communism respectively
* USA supports a democratic political landscape, where people in society are free to create their own political parties and contest in elections, which are free of coercion and fair
* In a communist society, the government is controlled by one political party, and political dissent is not tolerated
* In economics, democracy represents individuals' right to own property and means of production
* Communism calls for a centrally-planned economy system, where the government takes control of all the capital and industry in the country in an effort to get rid of economic inequality
* Western powers were involved in the Russian Civil War in 1918 on the side of the anti-communist white army to get rid of the communist threat
* One of the reasons why the USSR was not part of the League of nations, as the the Brittan and other capitalist nations feared the influence of USSR, considering Lenin's intentions for world communist revolution
* **Because the two ideologies contradict each other -> Cannot co-exist -> Ideological difference -> both sides to view each other as a threat to their own political and and economic influence, as well as their own security -> Feelings of mistrust and Misunderstanding -> Basis for the Cold War**

### Feelings of mistrust

* Both the USSR and USA formed an military alliance during WWII
* But, due to the delay in Allied opening of the second front to assist the USSR in the war, Stalin had suspicions that the allies did so to weaken the USSr
* There were also disagreements during the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences over the treatment of Germany, which added on to their mistrust of each other
* USA also did not inform Stalin about their plans to develop the atomic bomb until their first successful test
* USA dropped the bomb on Japan to end the war quickly as well has having the hope the USA would have political leverage over the USSA after the war
* Stalin was unhappy that the USA was trying to create a nuclear monopoly behind his back
* **These actions deepened the feelings of mistrust -> Competing for a dominant role in post-war Europe to increase their political and economic influence in Europe**

## Yalta Conference

* February 1945 - Germany was not defeated yet -> Had to come off as united

### Why?

#### Decide on the Long term future of Germany

* After the war, the Nazi Government in Germany crumbled
* Roosevelt wanted a revival of Germany's economy, which they believed was important for Europe's recovery
* Majority of the Deaths in WWII were from the USSR, with 22 million dead, compared to Britain's 450,000 and the USA's 400,000
* Stalin wanted a weak Germany that could no longer pose a threat to the USSR, and wanted to do this by exacting reparations from Germany to repair the USSR's economy
* The reparations would also compensate the USSR for their losses in the war, and help to restore the USSR's economy and power
* **Differing objectives in Germany -> Needed to decide on arrangements for post-war Germany -> Yalta**

#### Decide on the future of Eastern Europe

* WWII left Europe in a state of chaos, destruction and famine
* Governments and empire in Europe also crumbled as a result of the war, for example the totalitarian regimes of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy
* Allied powers, such as Britain and France also suffered great damage in their physical landscape, economies and influence, and were not longer in a position to be post-war decision makers
* Shattered economies and power vacuum in Europe meant that most European countries were unable to rebuild themselves without external help
* **Gave US and the USSR the opportunity to extend their sphere of influence -> Western leaders wanted to grant Stalin a sphere of influence in Europe -> Discussions of the future of Eastern Europe -> Yalta**

### Success?

#### Yes

* An agreement had been reached on a number of points
* Creation of the United Nations to replace the League of Nations
* Division of Germany and Berlin into Soviet, American, British and French zones of occupations
* Free elections in the State of Eastern Europe
* USSR entry into the war in Asia-Pacific, on the condition that the SAkhalin island was given to USSR, along with parts of Manchuria
* **Yalta -> Division of Germany into 4 Zones/ Declaration for liberated Europe -> Able to come to an agreement over the future of Europe -> Success**

#### No

* Open to differing interpretations
  * Stalin had a very different interpretation of the Yalta agreement, particularly over the whole idea of 'democracy' and 'free speech'
  * Stalin used the communist interpretation, in which the Communist party represented the people and no opposition was allowed
  * This disappointed may people in the West who used the Western interpretation, which was along the lines of the American system
* During the Yalta Conference, the allies agreed that there would be free elections in Poland
  * This meant Poland was either democratic or friendly to the USSR, and many leading figures were not friendly to the USSR
  * The only way Stalin could ensure a friendly poland was through arresting Non-communist leaders, and establishing a communist government
* **Yalta -> No details to agreements over Germany and Stalin's broken promises over poland -> Failure**

## Potsdam conference

* Agreed on
  * Details of the zone of occupations of Germany
  * Reparations were to be collected in the form of industrial equipment from own zone
  * USSR receive additional form other Zones as its zone was mainly agricultural and had suffered the most due to war
  * New borders of Poland confirmed
* **Potsdam -> Able to come to an agreement over the future of Europe -> Success**
* Disagreed on
  * Details of boundaries between the zones
  * Amount of reparations Russia wanted to take (Could take whatever it wanted form its zone, and 10% of the industrial equipment in Western zones), Britain and US thought this was too much
  * Stalin arresting non-communist leaders of Poland
  * Communists were coming to power in Eastern Europe, alarming america and Britain
  * Truman did not inform Stalin about the atomic bomb

### Tensions

#### No more common enemy

* With the defeat of Germany, there was very little to unify them
* Deep rooted division that existed between the democratic countries of the west and the communist USSR began to resurface at Potsdam and Yalta
* Suspicions between USSR and USA began to build up
* Relations broke down largely due to disagreements that surfaced in the Potsdam conference
* For example, Stalin's change of mind about Poland and the declaration of Liberated Europe
* During the Yalta Conference, the USSR promised that there would be free elections in Europe to allow them to create democratic institutions of their own choice
* But Stalin changed his mind at Potsdam, and this led the Truman feeling increasingly suspicious when Stalin did not keep to his word
* **No more common enemy -> Stalin's broken promises -> Feelings of suspicion -> Basis for the Cold War**

#### Truman's 'Get Tough' attitude

* Roosevelt was keen to appease Stalin by making multiple concessions to Stalin at Yalta
* Truman, who replaced Roosevelt at the Potsdam conference, had a firmer stance against the USSR and communist countries
* This was in view of the extension of the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, and Stalin's broken promises at Yalta
* **Confrontational attitude of Truman towards the USSR -> Very hard to agree -> could not agree at Potsdam**
* **Confrontational attitude of Truman -> Feelings of hostility and tension between USSR and USA -> Basis for the cold war**

#### Disagreements over the future of Poland

* During the Yalta Conference, the Allies had agreed that there would be free elections in Poland
* This meant Poland was either democratic or friendly to the USSR, and many leading figures were not friendly to the USSR
* The only way Stalin could ensure a friendly poland was through arresting Non-communist leaders, and establishing a communist government
* Churchill secretly ordered plan to invade USSR to force them to uphold the agreement at Yalta
* The invasion never happened, but it was evident that relations between both sides have soured considerably
* **Poland -> Confrontational attitude of Truman -> Feelings of hostility and tension between USSR and USA as he could not uphold his promises-> Basis for the cold war**

#### Atomic monopoly

* Truman had not fully informed about the exact nature of the atomic bomb, although Churchill was informed
* There were dropped shortly after the end of the Conference and the Pacific War ended without the need for Russian help
* By this time, Russia had already declared war on Japan in an attempt to seize territories in Manchuria and Sakhalin islands, and was not allowed to take part in the occupation in Japan
* Stalin started to form suspicions on the west, as the Stalin thought they could be hostile, and planned to use it against the USSR, thus not informing them about it
* This led to the start of the arms race
* **Atomic monopoly -> Stalin thought the USA was hostile -> Suspicious of the west -> Hostile -> Arms race -> Start of the Cold war**

## Outbreak of Cold War

### Salami tactics

* After WWII, Stalin began establishing a ring of satellite states around the Soviet Union through the use of Salami Tactics

#### National security concerns

* During WWII, the USSR had suffered terrible casualties as a result of German invasion of the USSR
* About 80% of Germany troops were spent fighting on the eastern front, thus the USSR bore much of the brunt of the war&#x20;
* Stalin felt justified to create a buffer zone to prevent another western invasion, and expanded into Eastern Europe to ensure that the governments installed were friendly to the USSR
* Filled the post-war power vacuum in europe by establishing a ring of satellite states through the use of salami tactics
* **Salami tactics -> Established sphere of influence and buffer Zone -> Prevent western invasion -> Ensured the Security of the USSR**

#### Spread communism

* Salami Tactics were seen as defensive in nature to stalin
* West saw it as acts of aggression that saw stalling progressively undermining the governments of eastern europe
* They subverted the electoral process and installed a series of Communist governments, and even extended control by taking over countries such as Czechoslovakia
* Not justified as they were compromising the independent states rights and to free elections and spreading their influence and dominance forcefully
* Thus, the USA adopted the policy of containment during the Cold war, to prevent the spread of communism outside of Asia, Africa and Europe by using its economic power
* The Marshall plan was where economic aid was given to western European countries as it believed in that communism could only be stopped in Europe if it became wealthy
* **Salami tactics -> Spread communism -> threatened the sovereignty of the free world -> Containment Competition between the superpower blocs for spheres of influence -> Tensions -> basis for cold War**

### Containment

#### Stop the challenge of communism

* After WWII, Stalin began establishing a ring of satellite states around the Soviet Union through the use of Salami Tactics, and installed a pro-Communist government in these countries, starting from poland
* The US perceived the USSR as being aggressive in wanting to spread its influence and dominance over the world
* This led to the US policy of Containment in order to stop the spread of Communism
* The Marshall plan committed the USA to giving economic aid to reconstruct Europe, regardless whether the countries were under communist influence or otherwise
* An economically strong europe was vital to the US, as Europe was its main export market, and no one would buy american goods in europe if the price was too high
* The economic situation in Europe would also provide opportunities for the communists to promote communism as an attractive alternative and solution to the problems&#x20;
* **Containment -> Marshall plan -> Provided financial assistance to countries, rather than through a direct confrontation with the USSR -> Dealt with the threat of the USSR -> Successful / Defensive in nature**

#### Challenge Soviet influence in Europe

* The USSR's actions were misinterpreted as being aggressive in nature
* The USSR felt that there was a need to spread influence over Eastern Europe, to create a buffer zone in the event of a western invasion
* During WWII, the USSR had suffered terrible casualties as a result of German invasion of the USSR
* About 80% of Germany troops were spent fighting on the eastern front, thus the USSR bore much of the brunt of the war
* The USSR found the Marshall Plan to be a threat to its sphere of influence in europe
* The USA made the offer of assistance open to the USSR and its satellite states, as part of the Marshall Plan
* Targeted move, as the USSR would open itself to USA's sphere of influence if it accepted the aid under the plan
* If the USSR refused, and disallowed the satellite states to take part, relations between the states and the USSR would be strained
* The USSR was thus obliged to respond in the form of COMINFORM as well as the Molotov Plan,
* **This gave the USSR control over the government of that satellite states and was a viable alternative to the marshall plan -> Countered US influence -> USSR winning cold war**
* **Containment -> Threatened USSR Sphere of influence -> Deepened the misunderstanding -> Further competition -> Formed the basis for the cold war -> Not successful/ Aggressive**

### Berlin Blockade

#### Prevent the spread of Western influence

* There was the currency issue in Germany
* Due to German involvement in WWI, and the collapse of the totalitarian Nazi Government, there was high inflation in Germany after WWII
* Western Germany which was under the control of the allies had the Germany dollar, to prevent hyperinflation and to stabilize the prices of German exports, leading to strong economic recovery in the western Zones
* Eastern Germany under the control of the USSR had the Eastern Dollar, to rival the western dollar and curb inflation due to the flooding of worthless Reichsmark and Rentenmark notes from the western zone to the soviet zone, where they still could be used
* But, the west did not accept the Eastern dollar in Berlin, and the German dollar had higher value than the eastern dollar, leading to hyperinflation in east berlin and serious economic impacts
* **Currency issue ->  Challenge to Soviet Authority in the East -> Berlin Blockade -> Force the west to withdraw from Berlin, and stop challenging Soviet authority**

#### Prevent the **creation of West Germany**

* The USSR planned to weaken Germany, so that they would not pose a threat to the USSR's security, and to exact reparations from them to rebuild the USSR's economy
* The allies wanted a strong Germany to stop the spread of communism and to allow Europe to recover from WWII
* The zones of Germany occupied by the USA and Britain combined to form Bizonia to overcome an economic crisis in the western Zones
* Stalin felt threatened by the emergence of a powerful western state, as it went against his ideals of a weakened Germany, and was a challenge to his sphere of influence
* **Formation of West Berlin -> Threatened USSR sphere of influence -> Force the west to stop challenging soviet authority -> abandon their plans to unify the 3 occupation zones to form west Germany**

### Failure of Berlin blockade

#### Berlin Airlift

* Britain, France and the US united their zones under trizonia to reduced the costs of administering 3 different zones
* USSR saw this as an attempt be the west to challenge his sphere of influence in Europe and decided to take over Berlin in a bid to assert his ground and force the western nations out
* USSR forces blockaded all road, rail and water routes into West Germany, stifling the vital flow of food, coal and other supplies, and preventing the access of western nations into Berlin
* USA and UK forces then embarked on the Berlin Airlift to re-supplied the allied sectors with food and necessities
* The success of the airlift led to the western nations gaining much popularity and prestige, and anchored capitalist influence in West Germany, further challenging the USSR's sphere of influence
* **Berlin airlift -> West gained popularity and prestige, anchored capitalist influence in west Germany -> Failed to expand communist influence in Berlin, lost soviet prestige instead -> Failure**

#### Unable to stop the west from creating West Germany

* The West was provoking and challenging USSR's control over western Europe by refusing to accept the Eastern dollar in West Berlin
* Stalin decided to force the West out by implementing the Berlin blockade
* USSR forces blockaded all road, rail and water routes into West Germany, stifling the vital flow of food, coal and other supplies, and preventing the access of western nations into Berlin
* The west wanted to retain their foothold in West Berlin and not succumb to Soviet Pressure and responded by flying supplies into west Berlin
* When Stalin finally relented and lifted the blockade, there West proceeded to create and independent democratic West Germany
* **Berlin blockade -> Creation of west Germany -> Went against stalin's objectives of dividing and making sure Germany was weak to exact reparations, and to ensure USSR security -> Failure**

### Germany's division

#### Yalta and Potsdam agreements

* The USSR planned to weaken Germany, so that they would not pose a threat to the USSR's security, and to exact reparations from them to rebuild the USSR's economy
* The allies wanted a strong Germany to stop the spread of communism and to allow Europe to recover from WWII
* This lead to a inability to agree at Potsdam, and thus there was no agreement at Potsdam over the Long-term plans for Germany
* This led to secret meetings within the western allied states, where they agreed to create an independent west German State
* Soviets responded by creating a communist east German State
* **Failure to agree at Yalta and Potsdam -> Secret meetings between the western allies -> Formation of western Germany -> Creation of east Germany -> Permanent division of Germany**

#### Response to Berlin Blockade

* The West was provoking and challenging USSR's control over western Europe by refusing to accept the Eastern dollar in West Berlin
* Stalin decided to force the West out by implementing the Berlin blockade
* USSR forces blockaded all road, rail and water routes into West Germany, stifling the vital flow of food, coal and other supplies, and preventing the access of western nations into Berlin
* The west wanted to retain their foothold in West Berlin and not succumb to Soviet Pressure and responded by flying supplies into west Berlin
* When Stalin finally relented and lifted the blockade, there West proceeded to create and independent democratic West Germany
* Soviets responded by creating a communist east German State
* **Berlin blockade -> Failed to prevent the Creation of West Germany -> Creation of East Germany -> Permanent division of Germany**

### NATO

#### Response to Berlin Blockade

* One of the actions that triggered Stalin to impose the blockade was the western allies decision to introduce the German dollar in West Berlin, and the creation of the Eastern Dollar in East berlin as a response
* The west did not accept the Eastern dollar in Berlin, and the German dollar had higher value than the eastern dollar, leading to hyperinflation in east berlin and serious economic impacts
* This led to Stalin imposing the blockade, which was perceived as the west to undermine their control in West Berlin and their attempts to revive the economy in West Berlin
* Thus, they formed NATO
* **Berlin blockade -> Challenged Western prestige and control in west Berlin -> Formation of NATO -> member countries used collective security in the face of communist aggression -> Stalin could not expand sphere of influence**

#### Greater US influence over Western Europe

* The US feared that countries of western europe might deal with their own security concerns by negotiating independently with the USSR
* There was a need to strengthen the security of western Europe
* Western European countries were also fearful of the USSR exerting its influence over Europe through military means
* Need to have American troops permanently stationed over europe to counter the USSR's strength and influence
* **Fear of aggressive expansion of sphere of influence by USSR -> Need to strengthen europe -> Formation of NATO in 1949 -> Collective security against any communist aggression**&#x20;

### Warsaw pact

#### Response to NATO

* The US feared that countries of western europe might deal with their own security concerns by negotiating independently with the USSR
* There was a need to strengthen the security of western Europe
* Western European countries were also fearful of the USSR exerting its influence over Europe through military means
* Need to have American troops permanently stationed over europe to counter the USSR's strength and influence
* Thus, they agreed to form NATO, where member countries would utilise collective security against communist influence
* The USSR saw the formation of NATO as a threat to its own security, and thus formed the Warsaw Pact
* **NATO -> Challenged USSR sphere of influence -> Formation of Warsaw pact -> two competing military alliance -> military confrontation and arms race -> Outbreak of cold war**

#### Greater Soviet influence and control over Eastern Europe

* The USSR already occupied eastern Europe since 1945, and the Warsaw pact only formalised the arrangement where all the satellite states would come under the leadership of the USSR
* Collective security against any external aggression
* Complemented Comecon and Cominform
* Respect the sovereignty and political independence of other countries, and not interfere in each other's internal affairs
* In reality, it was only to defend the USSR from any further invasion, especially from western europe
* During WWII, the USSR had suffered terrible casualties as a result of German invasion of the USSR
* About 80% of Germany troops were spent fighting on the eastern front, thus the USSR bore much of the brunt of the war&#x20;
* **Needed to ensure USSR security against Western invasion -> Formation of warsaw pact where satellite states would help defend the USSR -> two competing military alliance -> military confrontation and arms race -> Outbreak of cold war**
