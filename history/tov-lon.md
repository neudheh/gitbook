## Impacts of the treaty of Versailles

### German humiliation

* They objected to the war guilt clause, which forced Germans to take full responsibility for the outbreak of WWI
* In doing so, this gave the allies the right to levy reparations amounting to 6,600 million pounds on Germany
* The Germans maintained that they were not the only country responsible for the outbreak of the war, with the Russians and the Austro-Hungarian empire playing a role in the outbreak of the war
* The war guilt clause was imposed despite the fact that the German government signing the treaty was the newly-formed Weimar government
* **Since the Germans were not allowed to contest this claim, they felt that the treaty of Versailles was dictated peace which was forced onto them, leading them to feel that it was a diktat**

### German military reductions

* Under the Treaty, it was stipulated that the German army was to be reduced to 100,000
* To prevent the build up of reserves, officers were to serve for 25 years and men for 12
* Conscription was prohibited and only armaments sufficient for such a small army were to be retained
* The rest of the German arsenal was to be destroyed under allied supervision
* This meant that the great German army had to be shamefully dismantled
* All of Germany west of the rhine and up to 50 km east of it was to be a demilitarized zone
* **The Germans had venerated their military superiority since the German wars of unification and this forceful demilitarisation also meant a blow to German national pride -> blow to German pride/ national security**

### German economic weakness

* The war guilt clause had given allies the right to demand compensation form Germany for the huge costs of WWI
* Germany was made to pay reparations through ongoing payments to the allies through the surrender of coal and other resources at set periods
* Germany was also suffering economic problems due to its efforts in the war
* 15% of the active male population was lost -> severe shortage of workers to rebuild the economy
* Reparations was an additional burden which further worsened German economic conditions
* Hampered Germany's ability to pay on time
* When Germany failed to make a payment on time, France sent its army into the Ruhr industrial region of Germany to confiscate coal and other goods as payments
* Worsened the economic crisis and led to a general strike of German workers in the Ruhr
* **Contributed to hyperinflation in 1923 and the threat of economic collapse**
* **Many Germans had lost their jobs and were living in hardship and poverty -> magnified German economic woes and led to hardship for the Germans**

### **Territorial reductions**

* Germany lost its overseas colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but also resource-rich regions like the Rhineland, the Saar coal region as well as parts of Poland
* Injured the pride of German people as well as damaged Germany's economy
* Prevented German expansion through merger with other territories, especially the former Austria-Hungary, who had been allies in the war
* After the empire was dissolve, Austria became a separate republic
* Did not allow it as this could strengthen Germany's position in Europe
* **Embarrassing for German colonies as the previously colonial power's empire was not only curtailed but the loss of territories meant utter humiliation for a proud Germany**

### **Self-determination**

* Germany was not invited to the Paris Peace Conference and was forces to sign the Treaty or war would resume
* Brought much unhappiness to Germans as they were not allowed to discuss the terms of the treaty
* Self-determination was also not applied to Germany and ethnic Germans were forced to become part of other national like Czechoslovakia and the "free city" of Danzig
* **Self-Determination seemed to apply only to the winners of the war -> Unfair towards Germans** **-> dictated peace which was forced onto them, leading them to feel that it was a diktat**

### Not justified: Treaty of Brest-Litovsk

* Germany had imposed a harsh peace settlement on Russia during the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which had seen Russia lose up to 80% of its industries, 25% of its territories and 34% of its population, making the Treaty of Versailles seem mild in comparison.
* Germans were also not weakened as Germany was producing twice as much steel as Britian by 1925

## Did it achieve its goals?

### Yes

* Able to prevent German aggression and protect France in the 1920s
* Achieved through the disarmament and economic terms in the Treaties
  * Size of the army was limited to 100,000 men
  * Size of the Navy was limited to 15,000 men
  * Not allowed to have an air force
  * Not allowed to have tanks
  * Not allowed to have submarines
* Reduced the size and capability of Germany's armed forces, making it unlikely to be able to undertake an aggressive foreign policy
* Demilitarization of the Rhineland saw Germany forbidden to station troops in the Rhineland area bordering France, guaranteeing France's security
* Heavy reparations crippled the German economy and consigned it to a period of economic instability
* **Success as it sufficiently weakened Germany and acted as a deterrent against different acts of aggression -> safeguarded Europe against any possible German attempts to renew its aggressive foreign policy**

### **No**

* Germans objected strongly to the Treaty as they felt that they were not solely responsible for the outbreak of WWI, and were resentful that the allies had applied the War Guilt Clause, making Germany bear full responsibility for the War
* Self-determination only seemed to apply to the winners of the war
* Reparations seemed to be excessive by the Germans leading to even more resentment
* Were forced to sign the treaty, making it seem like a diktat
* Germany was not permanently crippled as the resultant compromise was not harsh enough, and only fuelled Germany anger and resentment
* **Anger and resentment -> manifested itself in Hitlers rise to power and aggressive foreign policy to right the wrongs of the Treaty -> triggered the road to WWII**

## League of Nations

### Structural weaknesses

* Made it hard to take decisive action and gave too much powers to the major powers
* Authorisation of any action required both an unanimous vote by the council and a 2/3 majority in the assembly
* The requirement for unanimity came about because the most influential members of the league did not want other nations to control their actions
* Example: When France invaded the Ruhr after Germany failed to make a payment on time, The league was powerless to stop them
* **Thus, council members were effectively given the power of veto, and found it hard to take action especially when the interests of major powers were at stake -> lost credibility as a peacekeeping organisation**

### Limited membership

* Despite being the founder and military the strongest after WWI, the USA did not ratify the treaty
* Preferred to engage in foreign affairs on their own terms at their own pace, rather than commit themselves to the league
* Germany was not allowed to join because of its role in causing WWI
* USSR was not allowed to join as it was seen as a threat due to its communist ideology
* Britan and France were also not willing to use their military to help the league
* The league had no army of its own, and could only criticize and condemn
* Example: When Italy took over the Greek island of Corfu, the league gad to resort to appeasement methos such as giving into his demands for compensation and a official apology before he would retreat
* **Militarily weak -> could not enforce its will -> lost credibility as a peace keeping organsiaton**

### Post war attitudes

* The devastation in the aftermath of WWI saw deaths in the million and economies of the European national were ravaged as a result of participation in war
* League was unwilling to use force and employed ineffective methods of negotiation and moral condemnation, encouraging aggression instead of deterring it
* Example: Polish invasion of Vilna, when Poland took over Vilna when it was given to Lithuania, and the league failed to make them withdraw
* **Reluctance to use their armed forces and deviations form the use of collective security -> could not enforce its will -> lost credibility as a peace keeping organisation**

### Failure of disarmament

* The league of nation attempted to organise disarmament conferences in 1926 and in the 1930s, but there was not cooperation from either Britan or France as both refused to disarm in order to protect themselves from an attack
* When the league was finally get all the powers to convene at Geneva, the Germans offered to disarm, but only if all other countries disarmed to their level
* The French and British both refused and the Germans walked out of the talks, leading to its breakdown
* **Unable to carry out its main aims -> Lost credibility as a peacekeeping organisation**

### Social welfare

* The league was able to make advance in terms of its social functions which it carried out through various agencies and commissions such as the International Labour Organisation
* Able to repatriate half a million prisoners of war
* Supported measures against leprosy and malaria
* **Improved social and living conditions in the world -> showed its ability to achieve its objectives as long as there was the will to do so**

### Solved small disputes between countries

* Able to resolve disputes between a number of countries such as Finland and Sweeden over the Aaland islands, and was able to get both to accept the decision to give the Islands to Finland
* Able to resolve the dispute between Greece and Bulgaria and was able to make Greece withdraw
* **Could resolve disputes -> showed its ability to achieve its objectives as long as there was the will to do so**
