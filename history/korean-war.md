# ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Korean War

## Division of Korea

### The formation of the two koreas

* As WWII was drawing to a close, the allies decided on Korea's post-war fate after the defeat of Japan
* At the potsdam conference, the western power agreed to divide Korea into 2 occupation zones along the 38th parallel, The USSR taking the north and the USA taking the south
* They agreed that Korea should be unified under a provisional government, but did not agree how to unite Korea and administer it
* The UN called for free elections to be held in Korea to establish the government of a united Korea
* But the USSR objected to the elections, as they wanted to establish their dominance and influence over political and economic developments
* Thus, there were no elections in North Korea, but elections went ahead in South Korea
* Syngman Rhee, an American backed candidate who was staunchly anti-Communist, won the elections
* The USSR established a Communist government, with Kim Il sung as its leader
* **North and South Korea were now ruled by ideologically opposed governments, each backed by a different superpower -> Division of Korea -> Both leaders wanted to unify Korea under their own leadership, using force if necessary -> Outbreak of war**

### Attempts to achieve unify Korea by North and South Korean Leaders

* Syngman Rhee was an authoritarian leader who was intolerant of his opponents, arresting and even killing them&#x20;
* He had plans to reunify Korea under his leadership, and began to undertake a policy of aggression against North Korea
* The USA thought Rhee was rash, and could involve them in a war they desire, and did not place enough weapons at Rhee's disposal to enable him to invade North Korea
* They continued to provide limited economic and military aid to South Korea, despite Rhee's requests for more, and withdrew their troops by June 1949
* Kim Il Sung in North Korea began to consolidate his control over North Korea, establishing a strong Communist Regime
* He was intent on reunifying Korea under his leadership and was prepared to invade South Korea
* He made several trip to the USSR to persuade Stalin to provide support to rebuild North Korea and wage war against the south
* Stalin agreed to provide military supplies and economic support, allowing the North Korean army to be heavily armed with Soviet tanks and artillery
* But, Stalin warned the USSR did not have any direct involvement in the war, as he did not want the Soviet Union to be entangled in a war against the USA
* **Kim sought and obtained the support of the USSR -> North Korea army was stronger than the South Korea's -> Opportunity to attack -> Outbreak of Korean War**
* **Actions and aims of the leaders of the North and South Koreas -> Set them on different paths -> Division of Korea**

## Outbreak of Korean War

### Korea

#### [Division of Korea](korean-war.md#the-formation-of-the-two-koreas)

#### [Attempts to unify Korea under their own leadership](korean-war.md#attempts-to-achieve-unify-korea-by-north-and-south-korean-leaders)

#### South Korean aggression

* Syngman Rhee had plans to reunify Korea under his leadership, and began to undertake a policy of aggression against North Korea
* The USA thought Rhee was rash, and could involve them in a war they desire, and did not place enough weapons at Rhee's disposal to enable him to invade North Korea
* They continued to provide limited economic and military aid to South Korea, despite Rhee's requests for more
* But, this Lack of US support did not deter Rhee from initiating border clashes with the North
* South Korean warships attacked North Korean military installations at the mouth of Taedong river
* But, these attacks failed
* The USA did not want to be in a war against the USSR, causing them to see Rhee's actions to be against their intentions, making them more reluctant to send heavy weapons to Korea
* **South Korea's attempts at offensive attacks -> Justified Kim Il Sung's reasons for an invasion because Rhee's ambitions of reunification clashed with Kim's aims for a unified Korea under a Communist regime -> Gave Kim the pretext to invade -> Korean War**

#### Unpopularity of Syngman Rhee's rule

* Syngman Rhee was an authoritarian leader who was intolerant of his opponents, arresting and even killing them, causing many to dislike his rule
* There were also many military desertions from South to North Korea in this periods, reflecting the unpopularity of Syngman's Rhee's rule
* There was also a communist uprising in South Korea, with strikes and riots by workers in several cities, that soon spread to the countryside
* **Syngman Rhee's unpopularity -> South Korea was left weak and divided -> Provided North Korea with an opportunity to attack -> Korean War**

#### Disengagement of superpowers

* In December 1948, the USSR withdrew from North Korea, as the North Korean government was established, and the army was well-trained and equipped
* There was also a communist uprising in South Korea, with strikes and riots by workers in several cities, that soon spread to the countryside
* It would only be a matter of time before South Korea fell to Communism
* Korea was a burden to the US, and they did not feel that it was important, as it had very little military and strategic importance to the US
* Maintaining US bases in Korea was seen as a financial liability, and ineffective in defending Korea because it was too small
* They could also easily defend Korea from the air, and did not need a base
* Thus, they passed Korea to the UN to supervise elections and to safeguard the sovereignty of South Korea against the communist forces, and withdrew their troops in June 1949
* However, the presence restrained the two Koreas in their aggressive actions, and the absence of superpower presence, showed the lack of superpower interest in Korean affairs
* **Lack of superpower presence -> Emboldened both sides to consider the use of aggression to unite Korea -> Border clashes -> Gave Kim the pretext to invade -> Korean War**

### USSR

#### Atomic Parity

* Kim Il Sung had previously requested for Soviet support for his plans to invade South Korea throughout 1949
* Rejected by Stalin due soviet involvement in the Berlin Blockade, and the US possession of atomic monopoly
* Thus, he was unwilling to support  to support the invasion, as he did not want to antagonise the USA which still had an advantage as a result of the possession of atomic weapons
* But, in August 1949, the USSR tested its first atomic bomb, allowing it to attain atomic parity with the USA
* The USA could no longer leverage on atomic weapons to threaten the USSR
* **Atomic Parity -> Stalin became more confident and was less fearful of possible retaliation -> Saw an opportunity to spread communist influence into the Asia-Pacific -> Invasion of South Korea -> Korea War**

#### Defence perimeter

* Despite advances made in the Soviet position in the Cold War by the end of 1949, Stalin was still fearful of the possibility of US intervention to stop the invasion of South Korea
* But, circumstances evolved in a way that would allow stalin to be increasingly confident that the USA would not get directly involved
* The US withdrawal from South Korea and its attempts to restrain the South Koreans from being aggressive to North Koreans in the second half of 1949 saw the restriction on the supply of heavy weapons to South Korea
* This gave the USSR increasing confidence of US reluctance to get involved in the defence of south Korea
* This mistaken perception was further reinforced when Dean Acheson left South Korea out of the Defence Perimeter speech in January 1950
* **Defence perimeter -> Gave Stalin the impression that the USA was unwilling to defend south Korea -> Confidence to support the invasion as it seemed unlikely that it would result in superpower confrontation with the USA**

#### Sino-Soviet Alliance

* The communist victory in China created a more favourable international climate for the USSR, and an alliance was quickly formed between China and the USSR
* Although the USSR withdrew its forces in 1948, it still wanted to support North Korea due to its strategic importance to the communist bloc
* China needed endorsement by Stalin, soviet economic aid, and soviet assistance to invade Taiwan in order to win the chinese civil war
* So, in February 1950, they signed the Sino-Soviet Alliance, promising to come to each others aid if either country was attacked
* Mao Zedong could now commit his attention to the assistance of North Korea if the invasion did no go smoothly
* The USSR also did not directly need to be involved in a conflict against the USA, making them more willing to support the invasion
* **Sino-Soviet alliance -> Stalin changed his mind -> Provided military support to North Korea -> Gave North Korea a Significant boost and advantage for it to launch an attack on the south in June 1950**

### USA

#### Initial reluctance to maintain long-term presence in South Korea

* Korea was not of as much importance to USA and the western bloc compared to the communist bloc
* There were also other areas in the Asia-Pacific, which were more strategically important
* They also wanted to minimise overseas obligations and concentrate its resources on the ongoing cold war in Europe
* Maintaining US bases in Korea was seen as a financial liability, and ineffective in defending Korea because it was too small
* They could also easily defend Korea from the air, and did not need a base
* The border clashes with North Korea, and the unpopularity of Rhee's rule also caused the USA to lose faith in Rhee's government
* The USA was also willing to accept communist control over South Korea provided that it was not done overtly
* **Unwilling to give South Korea heavy military aid -> North Korea army was stronger than the South Korea's -> Opportunity to attack -> Outbreak of Korean War**

#### Series of missteps which gave communists the wrong idea

* The USA withdrew its forces from South Korea in 1949, as it considered Europe to be the most important area at the time in the Cold War
* It did not supply heavy weaponry to South Korea to prevent Rhee from launching a military offensive on the North, dragging USSR and China into a major conflict
* US Secretary of State Dean Acheson delivered the Defence Perimeter speech in Jan 1950, in which both South Korea and Taiwan were publicly excluded from the American defensive perimeter in the Western Pacific
* **Defence perimeter -> Gave Stalin the impression that the USA was unwilling to defend south Korea -> Confidence to support the invasion as it seemed unlikely that it would result in superpower confrontation with the USA**

## Involvement of USA in the Korean War

### Political pressure and to stop the spread of communism

* By early 1950, there was considerable on the USA to do more to prevent the spread of communism in light of the fall of China to communism
* The Republican Party heavily criticized the Truman administration for being weak, allowing for the fall of Hina
* This resulted in a review of the US foreign policy, resulting in NSC-68
* It gave the US the option of a military response to stop communist aggression, and increased the US military budget
* This committed the USA to a stronger stand against any communist threat, and called for the use of force to stop the spread of communism
* **NSC-68 -> No political ground to withhold US support form South Korea -> Failure to do so would be seen as encouraging the communists to use arm aggression to spread communism -> USA had very little choice but to intervene when the Communists openly invaded South Korea -> US involvement**

### Uphold US prestige and US position in Asia

* The USA was the main power in Asia and had influence across Asia, particularly in Japan
* The initial US strategy was to contain communism on mainland Asia by defending the belt of islands against further Soviet expansion
* They were reluctant to get involved in mainland Asia
* The open invasion of South Korea by Communist North Korea clearly armed with Soviet Weapons was an open challenge to US power and prestige all over the world
* **Invasion of South Korea -> USA had to act to uphold its position and prestige as a superpower -> Needed a strong response -> assure the world that it would continue to protect other countries against armed aggression -> US involvement**



## Involvement of UN in the Korean War

### US need to uphold the UN

* After the failure of the LON, the establishment of the UN was the second attempt at creating a collective security system within only a few decades
* The US saw the invasion of korea as a direct challenge to the UN, and believed that if the UN did not take a firm stand on Korea, it would lose all its credibility as an peacekeeping organisation
* There would be no way to check further communist aggression
* The US called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council in order to condemn the invasion and call for North Korea to withdraw from South Korea
* **Need to protect South Korea from the north and uphold the UN's credibility as a peacekeeping organisation -> essential for UN to intervene -> US mobilised the UN to condemn the invasion by North Korea and passed a series of resolutions in support of South Korea and authorised military intervention -> UN involvement in  Korean War**

### Absence of USSR from the UN security council

* The USSR was one of the 5 permanent member of the UN security council who had the power of veto
* They could stop the UN from passing resolutions to take action
* Since the USSR supported North Korean aggression, it was likely that they would exercise the power of veto to prevent the UN from being involved in the Korean War
* But, they were absent form the UN as it was boycotting the Security Council as the UN gave Taiwan a seat instead of the People's Republic of China
* **Absence of USSR -> Could not veto the decision of the UN to condemn the invasion and intervene -> Vote to condemn invasion and intervene was passed -> UN involvement in  Korean War**

### Dominance/ manipulation of the USA

* The USA sought to use the UN to pursue its Cold War objectives of containment
* The invasion of Korea represented an open challenge to US power in Asia-Pacific
* However, the USA wanted to send the right message to the communists, that it was helping the UN, not fighting communism
* It would also allow the USA to portray the communists as aggressors
* The US thus supplied the bulk of armed forces to be used in the intervention, and nearly 90% of all army personnel, 93% of all airpower and 85% of all naval power for the Korean war came from the US
* **Dominance/ manipulation of the USA -> US used the UN to pursue its interests in the Korean War -> US mobilised the UN to intervene in the Korean War -> UN involvement in  Korean War**

## Success of the UN forces

* The Incheon landing was a key example of how the leadership of MacArthur and the involvement of the Un helped South Korea to defend its territory
* The North Korean forces pushed the SOuth Korean forces to Pusan
* The UN forces made a daring amphibious landing at the port of Inchon
* A total of 261 ships landed and the UN forces faced little opposition
* Under heavy air bombardment and with their communications cut, the NOrth Korean forces were forced to flee north across the 38th Parallel
* Macarthur had achieved the UN's original objective to free SOuth Korea from occupation by North Korea

## Involvement of China in the Korean War

### Fear of the USA

* US was allied to the KMT which had felt to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil war
* US adoption of rollback in crossing the 38th Parallel to defeat the North Korean Army&#x20;
* China was fearful that the USA would extend this policy of rollback and invade China to restore the KMT government
* Fears were worsened then MacArthur continued to drive towards the Yalu River
* **Mao came under pressure form stalin and the CCP to defend China's independence and national security form the USA -> No diplomatic contact with the USA -> Fearful of an american invasion as it was allies with Taiwan -> May invade and restore the KMT -> China got involved in the Korean War**

### Actions of MacArthur

* He ignored Truman's instructions given before the crossing of the 38th parallel
* Truman instructed him to avoid provoking the Chinese, by telling him to let South Koreans to lead the advance, and western forces could not be deployed close to the Yalu river, and to stop the advance if Chinese soldiers' were encountered
* He also ignored China's warning to not cross the 38th parallel
* **Actions of MacArthur -> provoked the chinese -> Found MacArthur's actions threatening -> fearful of an american invasion  -> China got involved in the Korean War to stop western aggression**

### Sino-Soviet alliance

* Following the communist victory in China, Mao was keen on attacking taiwan where the KMT had fled to
* However, a successful attack was dependent on Stalin's support, which he had hoped to gain by helping North Korea's invasion
* Mao also had signed the Sino-Soviet alliance, which committed China to aiding North Korea
* A successful defence of Korea would also establish Mao's credibility, which was crucial in his competition with the USSR for dominance over the communist bloc
* **China wanted to gain an important ally and establish its position in the communist world -> Signed the Sino-Soviet alliance -> Obliged to get involved in the Korean War**

### Protect North Korea

* North Korea was a strategic buffer Zone for china against the American forces in South Korea
* It was also a traditional ally of China, as Korean soldiers helped to fight for the People's Liberation Army of CHina during the Chinese Civil War
* **Long standing ally which helped them in the Chinese Civil war and ensure North Korea was in place to protect them against a possible western invasion -> Morally obliged to assist them -> Obliged to get involved in the Korean War**

## De-escalation of the Korean War

### Limited War

* Limited war is the US decision to minimise the scale of the Korean war
* They did so as provoking China could mean a further escalation of the Korean War into a superpower conflict, which the USA wanted to avoid
* Escalation of the Korean war could also lead to the use of atomic weapons against China, leading the USSR into the war
* They also wanted to avoid a full-scale war with China
* UN forces would no longer cross into Korea and avoid further provocation of China
* **Limited war -> Ensured that the commander leading the UN forces would not act rashly to use nuclear weapons to resolve the conflict -> De-escalation**

### Sacking of MacArthur

* MacArthur was sacked on 11 April 1951 for insubordination
* He believed in seeking 'total victory' against China and North Korea
* Wanted to attack China to destroy bases supporting Chinese troops in Korea
* Called for the Use of Taiwanese soldiers begin offered by Chiang Kai Shek to reinforce UN troops in Korea and attack China
* Rejected as it was feared by Us leadership that this would lead to further escalation of the Korean War
* Publicly critical of Truman and wrote letters criticizing Truman and the US leadership -> Truman's loss of confidence in MacArthur -> Sacked
* **Ensure plan to de-escalate the Korean War was not compromised -> Sacked MacArthur -> Plan to limit the scale of the Korean War proceeded un obstructed and that an armistice could proceed**

## Who won?
