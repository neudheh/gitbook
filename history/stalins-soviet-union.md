# ðŸª– Stalin's Soviet union

## Reasons for the rise of Stalin

### Non-disclosure of Lenin's testament

* When Lenin suffered a stroke and went into semi-retirement in **1922**, Stalin visited him often and acted as his connection to the outside world
* But, they often quarreled and Lenin became suspicious of Stalin's character and ambitions
* He made his views know in his Testament, voicing criticisms on his leading successors, and was especially clear in advising that Stalin be removed from his post as sectary-general of the Communist party
* When Lenin died in **1924**, his testament was read out at a meeting of the Central Executive Committee, where all of his potential successors were present
* However, they agreed that no notes were to be made when it was read out, and it would not be mentioned in future meetings.
* Some party members felt that Trotsky was a greater threat to them than Stalin, due to his powerful personality and his close connection to the army
* Lenin's warning was then ignored, and could not achieve its intended effect
* Stalin kept his post as secretary-general, which he used to appoint his supporters to the Communist party and manipulate the party to his will
* Stalin established a Troika alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev against Trotsky
* **With his position as sectary-general kept, Stalin was able to engineer the dismissal of Trotsky from his prominent position, and eventually expelled from the party, eliminating Trotsky's chances of succeeding Lenin**

OR

* &#x20;**Stalin was able to keep his position as sectary-general, and had control over the party's organization, allowing him to carry out his manipulations and shrink Trotsky's power base**

### Trotsky's unpopularity in the Politburo

* Trotsky was one of the strongest competitors that Stalin faced in succeeding Lenin
* He was regarded as Lenin's right-hand man
* He was the head of the Red Army, gaining the support because he led them to victory during the Russian Civil War, giving him a great deal of power
* This caused him to be over-confident that he would be the next logical candidate to support Lenin, and underestimated Stalin, causing him to not gather support for himself and alienating himself from the Party and other prominent members
* He also put little effort into courting possible allies
* He was seen as the biggest threat by others in the politburo, making him unpopular in the Politburo, causing other party members to form alliances against him
* The Troika alliance aimed to remove him from power by discrediting him
* Trotsky was outspoken and argued with Lenin and the Party on several topics, and as a result there was plenty of material his enemies could use to attack him
* Example: Trotsky criticized Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP) and the increasing control of the Party by the Politburo and the Central Executive Committee, openly challenging the organization the the Party's policies and thus were seen as acts of disloyalty to Lenin and the Party's decisions
* Trotsky believed in "Permanent Revolution", seeking to promote and incite communist revolutions around the world, but could not convince fellow party members on his idea
* Stalin argued for "Socialism in one country", calling for the strengthening of the Soviet Union  first before spreading communism to other countries.
* Stalin made sure that he had the support of other party members on his idea, and cleverly made it seem like Trotsky was moving away from the Party's decisions and ideas , affecting his credibility
* Trotsky fell very ill around Lenin's death and could not organize his own supporters
* He was unable to deal with party politics as the other Party members began to exclude him from decision-making and undermined his position within the Party
* **S: Due to Trotsky's actions and mistakes, he was gradually sidelined within the Communist Party and was in a position where he could be voted off the Central Committee. With the removal of his main opponent as a serious rival, Stalin was able to rise to power.**&#x20;

OR

* **S: The Troika alliance caused Trotsky to be taken off his post as War Commissariat and eventually expulsion from the Party, causing him to be eliminated from being the most likely candidate to succeed Lenin and allowing Stalin to gain the upper hand in the power struggle**&#x20;

### Pretended to be close to Lenin (not really good for essay)

* Stalin pretended to be close to Lenin, giving fellow party members and the general public the impression that Lenin trusted and favored Stalin&#x20;
* After Lenin died in 1924, Stalin organized his funeral, making it a grand affair
* He ordered Lenin's body to be embalmed and displayed in a Mausoleum in the Red Square in Moscow
* He gave the funeral speech and established himself as chief mourner, showing himself deeply sorrowful over the loss of Lenin
* He arranged for the city of Petrolgrad to be renamed Leningrad in Lenin's honor
* He kept Trotsky from attending Lenin's funeral by giving him the wrong date
* To the Russian people, it looked like Stalin was the natural successor to Lenin

### Control over party organization

* Stalin was appointed as Secretary-General in 1922, although it was not considered particularly important at the time, being an administrative post
* Stalin used his appointment as secretary-general to appoint and re-assign party members
* He was able to replace the allies of his opponents, especially Trotsky, with his own allies
* Many key Party officials thus owed their position to him and were loyal to him
* He controlled the Central Committee and spread his influence among local Party communities
* He was also in control of the Cheka, later the NKVD
* As a result, Trotsky's support base shrank considerably
* With his ideas discredited and a lack of support within the Party, Trotsky resigned from the head of the Red Army in 1925 and was expelled from the Party in 1927
* Trotsky continued to oppose Stalin through writings that criticized Stalin's control over the Party, his policies and his supported
* Stalin ordered to assassinate Trotsky while he was in exile in Mexico in 1940 &#x20;
* **S: With his support base firmly in place, he was able to influence many Communist Party members to support him when the leadership struggle happened following Lenin's death, facilitating his rise to power**

### Exploitation of ideological divisions

* Members of the Communist Party were divided between the moderates and the radicals
* The moderates were those who followed Lenin's leadership and ideology closely
* The radicals formed new ideas and challenged the system
* Stalin took advantage of these divisions within the Party, allying himself with both sides at different times
* **First**, he allied himself with moderate Politburo members, who saw Trotsky as a radical because he criticized and challenged party organization and policies, causing Trotsky to be expelled from the Party
* **Secondly**, he broke the Troika alliance and convinced the moderates that Kamenev and Zinoviev were plotting with Trotsky to overthrow the government, discrediting them and isolating them
* **Lastly**, he switched over to win the support of the Radicals
  * Bukharin and Rykov who were moderates, opposed Stalin's measures for rapid industrialization and central control of the economy, and wanted a return to the NEP
  * The rest of the Politburo sided with Stalin, and removed Bukharin from the politburo in 1929, and removed Rykov from the position of Premier in 1930
* **S: By exploiting ideological divisions, he cleverly made it seem that other party members were moving away from the interests of the party, sidelining them, placing them in positions where they could be voted off the party, and causing them to be removed from the party, eliminating them as a successor to Lenin, causing Stalin to rise to power**

## Economic impact of Stalin

* Stalin sought to modernize the Soviet Union and achieve the same economic and military levels as the Western powers, and attempted to achieve that through a series of Five-Year plans, setting targets for industrial and agricultural development for each plan
* **First FYP (1928-1932):** Expanding industry, transport and the power supply
* **Second FYP (1933-1938)**: Produce more manufactured goods, including machinery for the collective farms
* **Third FYP (1939-Interrupted by WWII)**: "Luxuries" like radios and bicycles, but was interrupted by WWII when war production became the main priority

### Collectivization

* Stalin sought to merge the small individual farms of the Soviet union into larger collective farms, or kolkhoz
* It was believed that larger units could be farmed more efficiently through mechanization, such as the use of tractors
* By **1935**, almost all of the farms in the Soviet Union were kolkhoz
* Complete reversal from the NEP in terms of its aims and measures
* **Aims**
  * To be more in line with the Party's motto of "Peace, Land and Bread for all"
  * To aid rapid industrialization
  * To promise a more secure food supply for factory workers
  * To export crops to other countries to raise funds for industrialization
* **Measures**
  * Land owned by the state
  * Crops distributed by the state
  * The quantities of crops that farmers were to produce, as well as their working hours were fixed by the state
  * Equipment, such as tractors were distributed by the state
  * Farmers who produced low quantities or were absent from work were punished
  * Shock workers, who were made to be model urban workers and farmers, were used to force peasants to join collective farms and remove kulaks
* **Results**
  * Many peasants, especially the Kulaks, killed their own animals, burnt their grain or produce, and hid or buried their crops in the ground to prevent them from being taken over by the state
  * Example: Bad harvest contributed to the Great Famine of 1932-1933, which led to the deaths of millions of peasants in parts of the Soviet Union
  * Example: Grain harvest dropped dramatically between 1931-1934 and did not recover to their 1928 level
  * Example: Loss of animal population were not recovered until after WWII in 1945
  * The state managed to collect the grain it needed to feed the industrial towns and export them to buy industrial equipment
  * Manpower for new factories were found as peasants left the countryside
* **Collectivization -> Drop in grain harvest/ loss of animal population -> Great Famine -> High human cost and did not meet the original objectives of increasing agricultural yield -> Aggravated the problem -> Failure**
* **Collectivization -> Enough grain to feed the industrial towns and export grain to buy industrial equipment,  freed up peasant workers who could now provide manpower in the cities -> USSR became a great industrial power -> Helped USSR during WWII as it now had an industrial base from which they could build enough armaments to fight Germany -> emerge as a superpower -> Success**

### **Industrialization**

* The Five-Year Plans sought to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union
* Factories in the cities would produce equipment for the mechanization of farming
  * With such equipment, fewer farm workers would be needed and could go into the cities to be factory workers
  * These larger and more mechanized farms owned by the state could then be able to produce more food to supply the factories and the cities
* Emphasis was placed on the development of heavy industries such as coal, iron, steel and electricity
  * Hundreds of new factories were built, and the industrial workforce expanded
  * The state set quotas for producing such machinery and other factory goods
  * Working hours and wages of factory workers were also fixed
  * Helped to propel the USSR to become a powerful industrial base for a powerful arms industry by 1941
  * **Overtook Britain, a leading industrial country, in iron and steel production**
* But, there was little growth in consumer industries such as house building, fertilizers and woolen textiles
  * Five-year plans had poor coordination and planning
  * Some parts of the economy face under production due to shortages of materials while others over produced to meet the quotas, but led to a lot of wastage, and the products were sub-standard and potentially hazardous
* People were living in cramped living conditions without running water or sanitation in overcrowded cities as more people moved to the cities due to industrialization
* The ambiguous targets meant that workers worked long hours with little time off, under poor conditions and low pay.
  * The welfare of workers was ignored in the drive to meet industrial targets
* **Industrialization -> race to meet production quotas -> welfare of workers ignored -> little to no improvement in quality of life -> Failure**
* **Industrialization -> USSR became a great industrial power from a backward agricultural state -> Helped USSR during WWII as it now had an industrial base from which they could build enough armaments to fight Germany -> emerge as a superpower -> Success**

## Political impact of Stalin

### The Great Terror (1934-1938)

* In order to consolidate his power and enforce party discipline, Stalin turned his attention to create a series of campaigns of political repression and purges to eliminate his enemies and remove any domestic oppression to the government in 1944-1938

#### Purges and show trials

* Stalin used the murder of Kirov as an excuse to carry out a series of purges from 1934-1938 to remove opposition to his rule
  * Many believe that Kirov was murdered on Stalin's orders, as party members had begun to see Kirov as a moderate alternative leader
* Political rivals such as Kamanev, Zinoviev and Bukharin were accused of conspiring with Trotsky to overthrow the government, and were tried in public show trials before being executed
* 500,000 Party members were arrested on charged of anti-soviet activities and were either executed or sent to gulags, including 70% of the Central Committee and 50% of the Party Congress
* They confessed to crimes they did not commit, after being tortured or having their families threatened
* Stalin was also suspicious of the Red army because of Trotsky's connections with the army
* They were loyal to Trotsky, but Stalin needed an army that was loyal to him alone
* Most senior commanders and officers (35,000) were accused of treason, tortured into confession and shot
* Including 80% of colonels and 90% of generals
* **Purges and show trials-> Ensured the survival of his regime and maintained his grip over the country**
* By the end of the 1930s, the purges had spread to the people, university lecturers, teacher, minder, engineers, factory managers and ordinary workers
* About 20 million ordinary Russians were sent to forced labor camps, where half of them died from overwork and ill treatment

#### **Arrests and interrogations**

* The secret police questioned and forced people to inform against their friends and family who voiced opposition against Stalin
* A quota system was in place but anyone could be arrested as an opposer
* Peasants, factory workers and intellectuals were arrested to prevent them from organizing opposition to Stalin's rule
* Many were killed on the spot or sent to forced labor camps, where they died of overworked, poor living conditions and ill treatment
* Nobody dared to oppose or challenge Stalin due to the prevailing atmosphere of fear
* **Arrests and interrogation -> Feelings of suspicion and hostility amongst the people -> atmosphere of fear with a high human cost**

#### **Loss of intellectuals, skilled workers and officers**

* The execution of engineers, scientists and skilled workers meant that Stalin's workforce towards the push for industrialization shrank
* The loss of administrators, engineers and teachers affected the quality of the Soviet civil service, industrial output and education
* Purging of the Red Army commanders and officers meant that there were no experience military personnel to lead the army and guide the inexperienced soldiers

### Propaganda

* Stalin used propaganda extensively to build up his image as a fatherly and benevolent leader, and to build a cult of personality to justify his harsh policies and the use of terror
* Propaganda was spread through art, literature, film, news, education and youth groups
* All offices, factories and classrooms had pictures of Stalin
* Photographs were edited to remove unwanted people, such as those that Stalin saw as a threat to his rul**e**
* History books were rewritten to boost Stalin's status and discredit his rivals as counter-revolutionaries
* **Propaganda -> Facilitated Stalin's establishment of his personal dictatorship -> bolster and expand the reach of Soviet power -> Gained popular support for his policies despite the use of terror to control the people and the brutal removal of his enemies**

## Social impacts of Stalin

### Fall in standard of living

* Soviet workers led very difficult lives in the 1930s due to rapid industrialization
* Long working hours and poor living conditions
* Lack of consumer goods such as textiles due to the focus of Five-Year Plans on heavy dustiness
* **Industrialization -> race to meet production quotas -> welfare of workers ignored -> little to no improvement in quality of life**

### Famine

* The ambitious agricultural targets of the Five-Year Plans meant that grain and produce were collected at the expense of the farmers
* As the farms were owned by the state, farmers could not keep the produce for themselves
* During the Great Famine, the state did not distribute its stockpiled grain, but sold it overseas to raise more funds for machinery and development
* 7 million peasants died of starvation due to the extreme shortage of food

### Living in fear

* The secret police had informers everywhere, and the slightest indication of anti-Stalin sentiments could warrant an arrest
* People also know that they were constantly being watched and judged by Stalin's officials
* If they were judge poorly, it would be more difficult for them to apply for housing, jobs or holidays
* If they stood out for the wrong reasons, or upset officials, they could fall victim to the secret police, be sent to labor camps or even killed

### Minority nationalities

* The various minority republics of the former Russian empire lost their autonomy with the creation of the Soviet Union
* One-party state with power in the hands in Stalin and the communist party in Moscow
* Governments were appointed and controlled by Moscow
* The irony was from Georgia, a minority background
* The famine in Ukraine was deliberate
* Nationalists were also targeted in the great terror

### New Soviet Man

* In 1929-1931, there was a cultural revolution that attacked intellectuals, privileged, religious leaders and artists to move the Soviet Union towards a more proletarian society
* Within this revolution was the creation of the New Soviet Man, the ideal Soviet citizen who was proud of being part of the modern industrial society and was willing to serve the state selflessly and enthusiastically
* The state upheld the achievement of seemingly ordinary people such as factory workers, teachers or miners, but many of them had some sort of connection to the Party
* Spurred more to exceed their targets, and publicly hailed Stakhanovites as heroes initially
* The pressure to perform up to the state's standard as well as the oppression faced by those who failed to do so had a negative psychological impact on society

### Women's entry into the workforce&#x20;

* Stalin's industrialization efforts encouraged women to enter the workforce and become productive members of the economy
* Women were not discriminate against or given lower pay
* State-run childcare centers were built to enable women to work in factories

### Compulsory schooling and increased literary rates

* There was free and universal education for all
* Every child was entitled to at least 9 years of free education and school attendance was compulsory
* Rise in literacy from 40-94% for men and 12-65% for women
* Stalin used education to control waht people were taught
* Lessons were loaded with communist propaganda and history was distorted to boost Stalin's Status and discredit his rivals
* Teeangers joined the Komsomol (Communist union of the youth) - Encourage outdoor activites and indoctrinated them to be loyal to Stalin
