# ðŸª– Stalin's Soviet union

## Reasons for the rise of Stalin

### Non-disclosure of Lenin's testament

* When Lenin suffered a stroke and went into semi-retirement in **1922**, Stalin visited him often and acted as his connection to the outside world
* But, they often quarrelled and Lenin became suspicious of Stalin's character and ambitions
* He made his views know in his Testament, voicing criticisms on his leading successors, and was especially clear in advising that Stalin be removed from his post as sectary-general of the Communist party
* When Lenin died in **1924**, his testament was read out at a meeting of the Central Executive Committee, where all of his potential successors were present
* However, they agreed that no notes were to be made when it was read out, and it would not be mentioned in future meetings.
* Some party members felt that Trotsky was a greater threat to them than Stalin, due to his powerful personality and his close connection to the army
* Lenin's warning was then ignored, and could not achieve its intended effect
* Stalin kept his post as secretary-general, which he used to appoint his supporters to the Communist party and manipulate the party to his will
* Stalin established a Troika alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev against Trotsky
* **S: With his position as sectary-general kept, Stalin was able to engineer the dismissal of Trotsky from his prominent position, and eventually expelled from the party, eliminating Trotsky's chances of succeeding Lenin**

OR

* **S: Stalin was able to keep his position as sectary-general, and had control over the party's organisation, allowing him to carry out his manipulations and shrink Trotsky's power base**

### Trotsky's unpopularity in the Politburo

* Trotsky was one of the strongest competitors that Stalin faced in succeeding Lenin
* He was regarded as Lenin's right-hand man
* He was the head of the Red Army, gaining the support because he led them to victory during the Russian Civil War, giving him a great deal of power
* This caused him to be over-confident that he would be the next logical candidate to support Lenin, and underestimated Stalin, causing him to not gather support for himself and alienating himself from the Party and other prominent members
* He also put little effort into courting possible allies
* He was seen as the biggest threat by others in the politburo, making him unpopular in the Politburo, causing other party members to form alliances against him
* The Troika alliance aimed to remove him from power by discrediting him
* Trotsky was outspoken and argued with Lenin and the Party on several topics, and as a result there was plenty of material his enemies could use to attack him
* Example: Trotsky criticised Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP) and the increasing control of the Party by the Politburo and the Central Executive Committee, openly challenging the organisation the the Party's policies and thus were seen as acts of disloyalty to Lenin and the Party's decisions
* Trotsky believed in "Permanent Revolution", seeking to promote and incite communist revolutions around the world, but could not convince fellow party members on his idea
* Stalin argued for "Socialism in one country", calling for the strengthening of the Soviet Union  first before spreading communism to other countries.
* Stalin made sure that he had the support of other party members on his idea, and cleverly made it seem like Trotsky was moving away from the Party's decisions and ideas , affecting his credibility
* Trotsky fell very ill around Lenin's death and could not organise his own supporters
* He was unable to deal with party politics as the other Party members began to exclude him from decision-making and undermined his position within the Party
* **S: Due to Trotsky's actions and mistakes, he was gradually sidelined within the Communist Party and was in a position where he could be voted off the Central Committee. With the removal of his main opponent as a serious rival, Stalin was able to rise to power.**&#x20;

OR

* **S: The Troika alliance caused Trotsky to be taken off his post as War Commissariat and eventually expulsion from the Party, causing him to be eliminated from being the most likely candidate to succeed Lenin and allowing Stalin to gain the upper hand in the power struggle**&#x20;

### Pretended to be close to Lenin (not really good for essay)

* Stalin pretended to be close to Lenin, giving fellow party members and the general public the impression that Lenin trusted and favoured Stalin&#x20;
* After Lenin died in 1924, Stalin organised his funeral, making it a grand affair
* He ordered Lenin's body to be embalmed and displayed in a Mausoleum in the Red Square in Moscow
* He gave the funeral speech and established himself as chief mourner, showing himself deeply sorrowful over the loss of Lenin
* He arranged for the city of Petrolgrad to be renamed Leningrad in Lenin's honour
* He kept Trotsky from attending Lenin's funeral by giving him the wrong date
* To the Russian people, it looked like Stalin was the natural successor to Lenin

### Control over party organisation

* Stalin was appointed as Secretary-General in 1922, although it was not considered particularly important at the time, being an administrative post
* Stalin used his appointment as secretary-general to appoint and re-assign party members
* He was able to replace the allies of his opponents, especially Trotsky, with his own allies
* Many key Party officials thus owed their position to him and were loyal to him
* He controlled the Central Committee and spread his influence among local Party communities
* He was also in control of the Cheka, later the NKVD
* As a result, Trotsky's support base shrank considerably
* With his ideas discredited and a lack of support within the Party, Trotsky resigned from the head of the Red Army in 1925 and was expelled from the Party in 1927
* Trotsky continued to oppose stalin through writings that criticized Stalin's control over the Party, his policies and his supported
* Stalin ordered to assassinate Trotsky while he was in exile in Mexico in 1940 &#x20;
* **S: With his support base firmly in place, he was able to influence many Communist Party members to support him when the leadership struggle happened following Lenin's death, facilitating his rise to power**

### Exploitation of ideological divisions

* Members of the Communist Party were divided between the moderates and the radicals
* The moderates were those who followed Lenin's leadership and ideology closely
* The radicals formed new ideas and challenged the system
* Stalin took advantage of these divisions within the Party, allying himself with both sides at different times
* **First**, he allied himself with moderate Politburo members, who saw Trotsky as a radical because he criticized and challenged party organisation and policies, causing trotsky to be expelled from the Party
* **Secondly**, he broke the Troika alliance and convinced the moderates that Kamenev and Zinoviev were plotting with Trotsky to overthrow the government, discrediting them and isolating them
* **Lastly**, he switched over to wind the support of the Radicals
  * Bukharin and Rykov who were moderates, opposed Stalin's measures for rapid industrialization and central control of the economy, and wanted a return to the NEP
  * The rest of the Politburo sided with Stalin, and removed Bukharin from the politburo in 1929, and removed Rykov from the position of Premier in 1930
* **S: By exploiting ideological divisions, he cleverly made it seem that other party members were moving away from the interests of the party, sidelining them, placing them in positions where they could be voted off the party, and causing them to be removed from the party, eliminating them as a successor to Lenin, causing Stalin to rise to power**
