# ðŸ’£ Cuban missile crisis

## Tensions between the USA and Cuba

### American political intervention in Cuba

* Cuba was strategically important to the USA, and the USA had some long-term economic interests in Cuba
* Thus, they frequently intervened in Cuban politics
* The American Ambassador of Cuba became a de facto proconsul, whose views were as eagerly sought after as those of the Cuban President himself
* Cuban nationalists increasingly resented American action of installing a series of 'puppet presidents' to guard its own interests in Cuba, as previous ambassadors planned to overthrow the cuban president
* Batista, an American Ambassador to Cuba, had an increasingly corrupt and dictatorial rule
* He exploited Cuba's commercial interests by establishing relationships with the American mafia, who controlled the illegal business in Havana
* He also established relationships with large American corporations, which invested heavily in Cuba
* He made use of his secret police to respress the Cuban people, as well as opponents to his regime, often through violent means
* However, the American government was reluctant to stop supporting batista, as their rivalry with the USSR might cause the USSR to bring communists to power in an area perceived to be its own backyard
* **US hostility -> Threatened Cuban economic survival -> Castro issued the First Havana Declaration of independence -> Anchored the Cuban government's anti-US attitude and worsened relations**

### **The Cuban revolution**

* In 1956, Castro, a cuban exile, returned to cuba from Mexico with a group of rebels, and conducted guerrilla warfare against Batista's government
* As support of Castro grew, the US's support for batista shrunk as a result of his increasingly repressive rule
* By 1958, Batista's soldiers were demoralised, while castro's army swelled to the thousands
* Batista fled to the USA, while Castro led his rebel army into Havana and established a new government
* When Castro came to power, he did not identify himself as a communist
* However, the USA was fearful of communist influence in Cuba, and was suspicious that he was a Communist, as the Cuban Communist Party supported the Cuban revolution
* **Cuban revolution -> Castro came into power -> Economic policies -> Fear cuba was aligning with the communist bloc and becoming a satellite state/ Threatened US economic interests in Cuba -> US become more hostile -> Triggered a series of measures aimed at forcing Castro out of power -> Breakdown of relations**

### **Seeking new markets for cuban sugar**

* The Cuban economy was too reliant on the Cuban Sugar Quota
* Cuban's Minister of industries, CHe Guevara, visited Egypt, INdonesia and Yugoslavia in 1959 to seek new markets for Cuban Sugar
* While in Cairo, Egypt, he contacted the Soviet embassy and the Soviet agreed to buy half a million times of sugar
* Castro and Khrushchev agreeed that a Soviet trade exhibition on tour in the America would go to america, in exchange for the USSR buying a million tonnes of sugar over 5 years
* THey also agreed to the oil for sugar barter
* **Oil for sugar barter -> US perceive Cuba's trade relations with the USSR as a sign that Cuba was aligning with the communist bloc -> Domino theory (fear of spread of communism to the region) -> US become more hostile -> Triggered a series of measures aimed at forcing Castro out of power -> Breakdown of relations**

### **Land reform law**

* Many Cuban sugar and tobacco plantations were owned by american companies
* Many of the richest people in cuba also owned large agricultural estates
* Wealth was concentrated among the ruling class of the country
* By passing the Land Reform Law, Castro wanted to break up the largest private estates in cuba and distribute them among the poorer farmers to solve the problem of inequality
* Saw this as fulfilling his promise to his farmers who had supported him during the revolution
* **Land reform law -> Threatened US business interests -> US hostility -> Triggered a series of measures aimed at forcing Castro out of power -> Breakdown of relations**

### **Friendship with Khrushchev**

* When Castro visited New York in September 1960 to address the UN General Assembly, he chose to stay in the poor district of Harlem, instead of the luxury hotel traditionally used by visiting world leaders
* Harlem also had a large African-American population, that faced racial discrimination in the USA at the time
* Khrushchev who wanted to form USSR-Cuban relations, visited too and decided to visit Castro in his Harlem hotel
* The meeting would be a double demonstration against the discriminatory policies of the USA towards African-Americans and towards Cuba
* The meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in Harlem strengthen their relationship, and highlighted tensions between the superpowers
* Both claimed to be leaders in upholding freedom, despite having different ideologies, political and economic systems
* Both also pointed out the imperfections of the other side as representative of their entire system
* His speech at the UN about the treatment towards african-americans angered conservative in the USA who did not want to grant them such rights, and also saw him associating openly with the enemy of the USA
* **Friendship with Khrushchev-> US perceive it as a sign that Cuba was aligning with the communist bloc -> Domino theory (fear of spread of communism to the region) -> US become more hostile -> Triggered a series of measures aimed at forcing Castro out of power -> Breakdown of relations**

## Breakdown of tensions

### Economic pressure on Cuba

* In an attempt to be less dependent on the USA, Castro started to expand Cuba's pool of trading partners, and sought trade agreements with countries like the USSR
* As a result of their oil-for-sugar barter, the USA planned to use its dominance over the Cuban economy to force castro to change his policy or bring down his government by crippling Cuba's economy
* This led to a series of breakdown of relationships as Castro responded by nationalizing all american businesses starting with the various oil companies who refused to process soviet oil
* The USA then further threatened Cuba's economy by decreasing the Cuban sugar quota from 3 million tonnes to only 700,000 tonnes
* This led to a further worsening of relationships as it brought Cuba to a closer alliance with Communist block when the USSR and China stepped in to by the surplus sugar
* **Hostile US economic policies -> Breakdown of US-Cuban relations -> Cuban became closer to the USSR and its allies who stepped in and fulfilled CUba's economic needs by filling the USA's position as Cuba's Main trading partner -> Drove cuba away -> Breakdown of relations**

### Bay of Pigs invasion

* The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed a plan to overthrow Castro's government by training Cuban exiles
* The plan was first developed by President Eisenhower in March 1960 and continued by John F Kennedy
* The Bay of Pigs Invasion commenced on 17 April 1961, when CIA-Trained Cuban exiles landed in the Bay of Pigs in Cuba
* Castro was well-prepared for the invasion, and the invading forces were subdued within 2 days
* It was a military disaster, leaving the USA humiliated
* The American ambassador at the UN General Assembly said that the US would not invade Cuba and had no control over the Cuban exile forces
* It was clear to everyone that the USA supplied the planes and weapons, and assisted in its logistical planning
* The USSR, Latin America and the UN were angry and surprised
* The invasion had provided Castro the opportunity to crack down on his opponents and rally the nationalist sentiment of Cubans around the defence of his government against further American intervention instead of weakening his regime
* **US threatened Cuba's Leader -> Khrushchev sent a letter of support to Castro -> Cuba sough a formal defence treaty with the USSR to prevent further US aggression -> breakdown of US-Cuban Relations**

### Operation Mongoose

* The failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion led to the USA authorizing Operation Mongoose
* It consisted of various intelligence operations such as sabotaging key Cuban industries and assassination attempts on key Cuban Leaders including Castro
* These attempts to unseat Castro were a clear threat to Cuba
* Large-scale US military exercises conducted in the Caribbean Sea simulating an invasion of Cuba caused Castro to feel that an US invasion of Cuba was inevitable
* **US threatened Cuba's Leader -> Khrushchev sent a letter of support to Castro -> Cuba sough a formal defence treaty with the USSR to prevent further US aggression -> breakdown of US-Cuban Relations**

## Installation of missiles

### Political gains

* The Sino-Soviet split in the early 1950s due to a difference in views on the application of communism in China and the USSR led to a competition over leadership over communism
* This was particularly after the death of Stalin
* A successful defence of Cuba could increase Khrushchev's prestige amongst the communist bloc, especially with China
* **Thus, Khrushchev placed the missiles in cuba with the aim to protect Cuba, so that the USSR would be the leader of the Communist world**
* The placement of missiles would also give him leverage in discussion of matters regarding Berlin, where he could force Kennedy to leave West Berlin in exchange for the missiles
* **This would allow Khrushchev to reassert and strengthen Soviet control over east Germany, and strengthen control over the communist bloc**

### Military gains

* In an bid to overthrow Castro's regime which was strongly anti-US, President Eisenhower approved the training and funding of Cuban exiles by the CIA
* President Kennedy formally approved the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1962 by the Cuban exiles who sought to overthrow castro
* The invasion failed, but it highlighted American determination to put an end to Castro's rule over Cuba
* This forced Castro to seek an alliance with the USSR and prompted Castro to declare Cuba to be communist in December 1961, establishing itself as a satellite state of the USSR
* **Hence Khrushchev proposed the installation of missiles as a form of protection for CUba against American political aggression**
* America's placement of Jupiter missiles in Turkey in april 1962 through NATO
* Given the geographical proximity of Turkey to the USSR, the Jupiter missiles had the range to attack major cities including Moscow, hence they posed a  national security threat to the USSR
* **This forced Khrushchev to place the missiles in Cuba so as to deter US from launching its missiles in Turkey, ensuring the national security of the USSR**
* Unlike the USA's missies, the USSR's missiles were not able to reach the USA from launch sites within the USSR
* Placing the missiles in Cuba meant a greater number of missiles could reach the USA, narrowing the missile gap
* Could enable the USSR to secure a base that was geographically close to the USA, which it previously never had

## Installation of missiles justified?

### Yes

* The installation of missiles was a defensive response to US aggression
* The USA had started to build up a huge lead in the nuclear arms race and far outnumbered the USSR in terms of the number of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (IBCMs)
* The USA also had installed Jupiter missiles in Turkey, placing Major Soviet Cities such a moscow within a range of a US nuclear strike
* The USSR became fearful that the USA was moving to a first strike strategy
* **Felt that there a need for the USSR to balance out the US threat -> Installed missiles in cuba -> Deter a possible US first strike by placing the missiles within range of major US population centres -> Gave the USSR some retaliatory capability -> USA cannot launch any attacks on the USSR -> Ensure USSR security**

### No

#### Nearly led to nuclear war

* It nearly led to nuclear war
* The secret installation of missiles in Cuba by the USSR was one the the reasons why it cam closer to nuclear war
* Wanted to force the USA into making concessions such as giving up West Berlin in order to regain the communist world from from China
* Hoped to secretly install missiles in cuba and present USA with a fait accompli in hopes of gaining a superior negotiating position with the USA
* Khrushchev denied having intention to install the missiles which the USA accepted
* This led to the USA to see the missiles as a soviet to develop a first strike capability against the USA, which destabilized the cold war, and was very threatening to the USA
* **USA was angered by the discovery of the missiles -> Missiles were perceived to be a bigger threat than they actually were -> pressure to use force against the Soviet Missiles in Cuba -> worsen tensions -> Nuclear war**

#### **Exploited poor US-Cuba relations to increase soviet prestige**

* The Sino-Soviet split in the early 1950s due to a difference in views on the application of communism in China and the USSR led to a competition over leadership over communism
* This was particularly after the death of Stalin
* A successful defence of Cuba could increase Khrushchev's prestige amongst the communist bloc, especially with China
* The placement of missiles would also give him leverage in discussion of matters regarding Berlin, where he could force Kennedy to leave West Berlin in exchange for the missiles
* **Challenges soviet leadership -> need to increase prestige -> Worsening relations -> opportunity to offer aid to Cuba -> Defend cuba -> Increase in prestige in the communist world -> leader of the communist world**
* **But, installation of missiles -> Challenged USA sphere of influence and prestige -> Blockade -> Worsen relations -> Nuclear war**

## US response **- Blockade**

* Political pressure for a strong response to the soviet missiles in Cuba to ensure success during the midterm elections
* Send a strong message to Khrushchev and prevent new missiles form reaching Cuba, and give USSR time to reconsider position

### Fear of soviet first strike

* Khrushchev oped to secretly install missiles in cuba and present USA with a fait accompli in hopes of gaining a superior negotiating position with the USA in the removal of missiles from Turkey, and giving up west Berlin
* Khrushchev denied having intention to install the missiles which the USA accepted
* This led to the USA to see the missiles as a soviet to develop a first strike capability against the USA, which destabilized the cold war, and was very threatening to the USA
* **USA was angered by the discovery of the missiles -> Missiles were perceived to be a bigger threat than they actually were ->  USA needed to send a strong message to the USSR that the missiles in cuba were a challenge to the US sphere of influence and prestige-> USSR would reconsider its strategy -> Back down -> Open the way for negotiation -> Avoid nuclear war and resolve the crisis**

### **Give the USSR time to reconsider and back down**

* On the 22nd october, Kennedy declared his strategy through a televised address to the people of the USA
* He announced the discovery of missiles in Cuba and demanded that the Soviet leadership remove them
* He also announce a blockade around Cuba, and all vessels would be checked by American Naval ships to ensure they did not contain more weapons before being allowed to proceed in Cuba
* The blockade would prevent further Importing and deployment of Soviet 'offensive weaponry'
* It demonstrated US resolve against the missiles in Cuba
* **Blockade -> Demonstrate US resolve against missiles in Cuba -> USSR would reconsider its strategy -> Back down -> Open the way for negotiation -> Avoid nuclear war and resolve the crisis**

### Not justified

* A blockade would be slow, and it does not remove the missiles already in Cuba
* Under international law, the deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba was perfectly legal with the agreement of the cuban government
* A blockade could be constructed as an act of war against Cuba, which could trigger a full scale conflict between the USSR and the USA
* **Blockade -> Act of war against Cuba, a USSR ally -> USSR would be angered -> Could worsen USSR/ USA relations -> Nuclear war**

## Resolution

### First Letter (26 oct 1962)

* Khrushchev sent a letter to Kennedy indicating that he was  willing to pull out the missiles from Cuba in exchange for a US non-invasion pledge
* The US was taken by surprised, due to the personal tone of the letter, causing them to doubt its legitimacy, and taking the time to verify the letter

### Second Letter

* While the US was thinking of a possible response, a second letter was received on 27 Oct 1962 (my birthday awww)
* The letter took a far more aggressive tone, and a new demand was made for the withdrawal of US missiles from turkey
* Khrushchev regained composure, and was probably under the pressure from politburo to get better terms after they were informed that the US was willing to compromise&#x20;

### Ending the Cuban Missile Crisis

* The USA would publicly accept the first letter which was felt to be authentic and likely to be written by Khrushchev who was under a lot of pressure
* Ignore the second letter, but offer a private assurance that the missiles in Turkey would be withdrawn in 6 months, as part of an original plan to withdraw the missiles which were out of date
* This would remain secret and not be released to the public by either side until 1989, as the link with the crisis cannot be drawn and the elections would be over by then

{% hint style="info" %}
There was a reputation that the USA won for many years due to the secret deal, and this can **affect the reliability of sources!!!**
{% endhint %}

* Negotiations between Robert Kennedy and the Soviet ambassador Dobrynin
* Negotiations were successful and a compromise was reached, as both sides were desperate to resolve it as they were losing control of their respective militaries (e.g. shooting down of U2 plane)
* Khrushchev made a public announcement on radio 28 Oct 1962, announcing that the Crisis was over
* On 30 Oct 1962, Castro wrote his letter of unhappiness
* Khrushchev was removed from office in 1964 and heavily criticized
* JFK became a donut... haha....

## Why did it not break out into nuclear war?

### Kennedy's statesmanship and skill in handling the crisis

* The crisis threatened to spiral out of control after a U2 spy plane was shot down on 26 october, and Khrushchev extended his own policy of brinkmanship by demanding in his second letter that the US remove Jupiter missiles in turkey to trade for USSR's removal of missiles in Cuba
* Kennedy ensured the crisis did not break out into a full-scale war
* **He decided to reply only to Khrushchev's first letter, enabling missiles in Cuba to be removed, diffusing the crisis**
* By sending the State Attorney Robert Kennedy to establish a secret deal with the Soviet ambassador to USA to remove the Jupiter missiles, **he ensured the missiles were removed in Cuba in exchange for the removal of Jupiter missiles, ending the crisis**

### Khrushchev's role in diffusing tensions

* After the US imposed a naval blockade in Cuban waters on 23 october 1962 threatened to escalate the crisis into a full-scale nuclear war, Khrushchev began extending his appeal for peace to Kennedy
* His first letter of appeal stated that he would remove the missiles in Cuba is USA promised to not invade Cuba, which Kennedy complied with
* **This act of diplomacy showed that Khrushchev played a significant role in diffusing the crisis and preventing it from spiraling out of control after the naval blockade**



## Who won?

### USA

* **Managed to get missiles out of Cuba -> Reduced the possibility of a USSR first strike -> Ensured national security**
* **Secret deal ensured that US concessions were not known -> NATO did not lose credibility for giving in to USSR**

### USSR

* **Managed to gain concessions from USA to withdraw missiles from Turkey -> Eliminated US threat to USSR -> Ensured national security**
* **Got USA to promise not to invade Cuba -> Protect Cuba -> Gained prestige in the communist world -> Leader of the communist bloc**
