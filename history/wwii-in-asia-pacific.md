# ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ WWII in Asia Pacific

## Important years

* **1931** - Manchuria
* **1937** - Invasion of China/ 2nd Sino-Japanese war
* **1941** - Invasion of Southeast Asia, Bombing of Pearl Harbor

## Reasons for invasion

### Fear of the west

* There were a number of instances where Japan felt that the West had discriminated against it and thus was racist against Japan
* Example: The Washington Naval Conference was organised by the USA, calling for the reduction in the naval forces of the Major powers (USA, Britan, Japan, Italy, France)
  * The ratio of naval strength between the powers was decided as 5:5:3:1.67:1.67 respectively
  * Japan had to reduce its naval strength more than the USA and Britan
  * Felt that the agreement was unfair and biased against them
* **Created resentment in the Japanese  and when militarism expressed that by expanding overseas as a way for Japan to be treated as equals with the western powers, this stood well with the public**
* **When Japan attacked Manchuria in 1931, it was seen as an act for patriotism and opposition against the discrimination against the west**
* When Japan wanted to attack southeast Asia, the only force capable of stooping Japan was the US Pacific fleet based in the Philippines and Hawaii
* The US had already shown opposition to Japan's efforts in the area of the oil and scrap iron embargo
* US was also in the process of negotiating with Japan for Japan to withdraw from China
* Japan felt that Asia should be freed from Western control so that it could be the leader of Asia
* Thus they wanted to establish the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' which included most of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region
* **It was likely that the US would intervene to stop Japan's attack on SEA, and Japan needed to neutralise the US pacific fleet to stop any intervention**

### Economic crisis

* Japan was affected badly by the Great Depression
* Had a very large import-export imbalance, which left it very vulnerable to protectionism after the Great Depression
* Export problem
  * Japanese exports were badly affected by protectionism
  * Sought to overcome this problem by having 'captive markets' where it conquered territories such as Korea, Taiwan and eventually Manchuria, and would trade with Japan in a way that would benefit Japan
* Import problem
  * Japan was very depended on imports of raw materials from other countries
  * Insufficient food and natural resources for the country
  * Japan also needed more raw materials in order to feed its industries and people
  * Manchuria offered a source of cheap raw materials
* Growing population
  * Japan needed to find room for its growing population
  * There was insufficient room in Japan and this prompted Japan to seek and conquer China to re-settle its population
* **As Manchuria was an area with abundant land and rich in resources such as coal and iron, Japan then decided that attacking China would be the answer to its fear of lack of resources in an increasingly difficult time especially just right after the Great Depression when its export Dropped and unemployment rose**
* Japanese Zabaitsus (Large companies like Mitsubishi and Sumitomo) were in favour of war to pursue economic gains through expansion of business
* Through getting rid of Chinese business competition in Northern and Southern China, the Japanese also stood to gain precious resources that could be used to develop industries and the food supplies to feed its people
* Viewed Chinese and inferior and incapable of putting up a strong resistance against Japanese invasion, strengthening belief of a successful attack on China
* **The Zabaitsus leveraged on their close relations with the military and engaged in warmongering and helped the military gain support and funding for their plans to start a war in China through the Marco Polo bridge incident by providing financial aid and political backing in the government**
* In response to the Japanese occupation of French Indochina and the continued aggression in China, the US began an embargo on stee; and scrap iron exports and cut off 80% of Japan's supply of materials to build weapons
* General trade embargo against Japan
* Japan left with a two year stockpile which threatened its existence and ability to continue to wage war
* In order to ensure its survival and to continuation of its war in China, Japan started to look to seize the resource rich colonies of the Western powers in Southeast Asia
* **As the US pacific fleet was the only force capable of stopping the Japanese, it was essential to eliminate the US Pacific Fleet before they were able to invade southeast Asia**
* **Would buy time to create a strong defensive perimeter to deter the USA from counterattacking so as to force them into negotiations, allowing them to retain large tracts of its empire**

### Strength of Militarism

* As a result of the Showa restoration from the 1890s, education emphasized on absolute loyalty to the Emperor, nationalism and self-sacrifice, producing a generation of youths who believed blindly in the emperor and in militarism
* The civilian government was weak and unable to control the military which increasingly dominated Japanese politics
* The militarists felt that there was a need for Japan to aggressively expand its territories, particularly in China
* Japanese foreign policy had been defined as a process of 'aggressive oppoturnitism', whereby the Japanese would take what they could when they could
* Strength and dominance of the militarists was such that the Kwantung Army in China was able to stage the Mukden incident and invade Manchuria using a flimsy pretext without informing the civilian government, and the civilian government which was against the invasion was unable to stop the military
* **Hence the militarists were able to dominate the civilian government and act with impunity in its bid to pursue the policy of aggressive expansionism in Manchuria**
* Series of incidents such as the Lague of Blood incident, May 15 incident and February 26 incident led the civilian government to be intimidated and fearful
* Military would assume power in 1932 when Martial law was imposed
* Disillusionment with the civilian government meant that people began to support the patriotic societies and agreed with what they were espousing -> national reconstruction, military strength, respect for authority ->Created culture that favored aggression and espoused superiority of the Japanese people
* Japan had accumulated many territories in the Pacific and North Asia
* The militarists wanted to build an empire in the Asia-pacific region that would match Japan's status as the leading country in the region
* Viewed Chinese and inferior and incapable of putting up a strong resistance against Japanese invasion, strengthening belief of a successful attack on China
* **The militaristic government, fuelled by their desire to establish Japan as a dominant country in Asia, would have pursued an aggressive foreign policy and thus attacked China in an attempt to gain access to resources and living space for its people**
* Army minister Hideki Tojo becomes PM in 1940, replacing PM Konoe who resigned as he was fearful of war with the USA
* Led the move towards war and the attack on pearl Harbour
* Favoured aggressive foreign policy and remove cabinet minister in favour with negotiation with USA
* USA attempted to negotiate its withdrawal from China, but failed as both sides rejected each other's suggestions
* The USA though Japan should give up all its claims and territories in China, including Manchuria
* Japan proposed a gradual withdraw from China over 25 years and for Manchuria to be permanently be given to Japan
* **The rise of Tojo and a pro-militarist government meant taht it was inevitable that Japan would adopt a aggressive foreign policy as there were increasingly unrealistic beliefs taht Japanese aggressive foreign policy would be successful and this set Japan on the road to aggression**

### Favorable circumstances

* The attack on Manchuria by Japan was greatly motivated by the Chinese weakness and disunity
* China was gripped by a civil war between the communists and  the KMT and this would give Japan a greater chance for further expansion
* As Japanâ€™s foreign policies could be defined by â€˜aggressive opportunismâ€™, it was only timely that an attack on China should be called before the opportunity slipped away and Japan would have to fight a long war that drained its money and resources.
* **International circumstances ensured that Japan was confident that its aggression would go unchecked and free from sanction from any source, and even if there was any, it would have little impact on Japan. As a result, Japan was able to invade Manchuria**
* Failure of the League of Nations evident in&#x20;
  * Inability to stop Italy's invasion into Abyssinia
  * Failure of getting Japan out of Manchuria
  * Lack of action to stop remilitarisation of Rhineland (violating TOV)
* Showed leagues failure in its role as an enforcer of international peace
* Favourable international situation
  * Stalin's preoccupation with consolidating power (purges during great terror)
  * Europe distracted with Hitler's aggression
* Distraction would have ensured Japan of non-interference with its plans in China
* **Japan would be assured that their attack on China would not be stopped and thus made use of the opportunity given to launch an attack on China in 1937 when their chances of success would be higher due to the conviction that there would be a lack of intervention by the Western powers**
* The Dutch and French were by 1940 under German occupation, leaving its colonies open to Japanese attack and occupation
* &#x20;The British were engaged in a war with Germany and Italy and was not in a position to stop Japanâ€™s expansion into Southeast Asia
* Thus Japan sought to exploit this opportunity as it felt that it was able to defeat the weakened forces of the colonial powers.
* **In order to ensure that it could successfully exploit this opportunity, Japan decided to attack Pearl Harbour so as to eliminate the US Pacific Fleet in order to prevent any potential US interference in its attempts to expand its empire.**
