# ðŸŽŠ End of the Cold War

## American economic and military superiority

* The economies  of the USA and western European countries saw a significant improvement in the early 1980s, as a part of Reagan's economic reforms
* In the 1970s, the USA suffered a severe economic downturn due to two oil crises in 1973 and 1979, as well as the great costs incurred in its involvement in the vietnam war
* Raegan thus encouraged individual enterprise, instead of having the people rely too much on the government for goods and services
* They cut national budgets and sold off national assets such as phone companies, oil companies and airlines
* Britain and other European countries followed suit
* This greatly restructured the economics of western europe and the USA, stimulated economic growth and launched a financial boom in the 1980s
* The economies of West Germany and Japan, and allies of the USA have been growing after the success of the Marshall Plan, which caused USA's economy to grow due to their partnership

### Renewal of the arms race and its impact

* Reagan supported a programme known as Star Wars, aiming to develop new technologies, such as satellites deployed in orbit around the earth to detect and destroy any potential nuclear attack by Intercontinental missiles
* Expensive, but the USA was able to fund it through its extensive financial network, unlike the USSR, who had already-stretched resources
* Star wars -> End of MAD -> Arms race led to instability due to fear of MAD as long as both sides maintained a balance ->  Star wars destabilised the Cold war due to Soviet Fear of nuclear first strike form USA -> USSR decided to re-arm
* NATO also decided to station over a hundred Pershing II missiles (IRBMs) in west Germany, which were nuclear missiles that could be moved around easily, and aimed at targets in the western part of the USSR
* This increased the threat to the USSR, forcing it to re-arm to keep up
* **Weakness of Soviet economy and failure of the reforms to revive the economy ->USSR no longer could compete with the USA/ continue the arms race -> Gave up competition with the USA -> Adopted the policy of new thinking -> Improved relations between USSR and USA -> End of Cold War**

## Weakness of the USSR

### Failure of the command economy

* Centralised planning led to inefficiency, as the economy did not meet people's needs
* The economy was quota driven, thus there was no emphasis on quality control
* The failure of agriculture meant that the USSR had to import wheat from overseas
* The USSR thus had a shrinking economy
* Whereas the USA had a competition-driven economy that was more efficient that the USSR's, giving them greater economic power
* **Weakness of Soviet economy and failure of the reforms to revive the economy ->USSR no longer could compete with the USA/ continue the arms race -> Gave up competition with the USA -> Adopted the policy of new thinking -> Improved relations between USSR and USA -> End of Cold War**

### **Political stagnation**

* The leaders who succeeded Brezhnev, such as Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, were committed to the communist ideology and saw the need to maintain a strong defence against the threat of invasion
* They were from the generation that had fought for the deal for international socialism and were traumatized by the German invasion during WWII
* Thus, they took a hard line approach against the USA, whom they saw as an ideological threat
* Thus there was barely any change out the way the Party ran the USSR, causing economic stagnation and social problems
* **Political stagnation -> Political reforms -> New leaders were more open to new ideas and reforms in the party -> Adopted the policy of new thinking -> Improved relations between USSR and USA -> End of Cold War**

### Social problems&#x20;

* The command economy resulted in a lack of motivation from the Soviet workers, thus leading to low levels of production and a lack of consumer goods that did not meet people's needs
* There was also a high rate of alcohol abuse and being absent from work, affecting the soviet economy
* The lack of consumer goods did not meet people's needs
* **Social problems -> Decline of the Soviet economy -> USSR no longer could compete with the USA/ continue the arms race -> Gave up competition with the USA -> Adopted the policy of new thinking -> Improved relations between USSR and USA -> End of Cold War**

### External burdens

* War in Afghanistan -> Suffered  heavy casualties, and was expensive
* Star Wars pressured the Soviets to re-arm, spending more of their already stretched resources
* The arms race cause the USSR to spend 16% of their gross national produce on defence, compared to 6% from the USA
* The satellite states had weak economies and needed subsidies and support, which drained their economy (They were selling oil for 10 cents!)&#x20;
* The resistance from satellite states such as hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 led to the Brezhnev Doctrine, where the soviets used force to stop breakaway satellite states
* The red army stationed troops in satellite states, draining the economy further
* **External burdens -> Weakness of Soviet economy and failure of the reforms to revive the economy ->USSR no longer could compete with the USA/ continue the arms race -> Gave up competition with the USA -> Adopted the policy of new thinking -> Improved relations between USSR and USA -> End of Cold War**

## Gorbachev's policies

### **Glasnost**

* Glasnost called for greater transparency, freedom of speech and expression
* The decision to allow the problems of the country to be discussed openly meant to allow for greater public debates to speak in favour of reforms
* Changes that he wanted to enact for the USSR could only happen if people were allowed to discuss the problems of the country openly.&#x20;
* Sought to give supporters of reform the space and opportunities to speak up in favour of the reforms and get the support of the Soviet People
* Only by doing so, could the long-term political problems (e.g. lack of effective leaders) and disengaged people be addressed.
* Political prisoners such as Andrei Sakharov were released, new editors were appointed to state newspapers, censorship on the books and media were relaxed, and the public had access to western radio broadcasts which criticized the communist party
* There were also new revelations about Soviet history, hoping to let russians know why his reforms were necessary
* People were more exposed to aspects of the world outside of the USSR and learnt about the better quality of life in the USA and western Europe
* People would be more free to speak up and ask for political reforms
* They grew more disillusioned with the party, and demanded for independence, causing the breakaway of the satellite states, causing the USSR to disintegrate by 1991
* **Reforms -> Forces of opposition and nationalism that could not be contained -> Collapse of the USSR -> USA was the only superpower left -> End of superpower competition -> End of cold war**

### **Perestroika**

#### **Economic**

* Economic restructuring to improve the efficiency of the economy
* He wanted to encourage greater interest, productivity and investment among the soviet workers in their respective industries
* Cooperative ownership was vital to the new soviet economy, and that it would be be consistent with Socialism
* His economic reforms tried to encourage private ownership of businesses, and encouraged citizens to set up their own businesses, and to expose the Soviet economy to market forces by allowing factory managers greater autonomy, and relaxing the central control of wages
* Failed as the soviet economy failed to respond to the attempts to restructure
* USSR relaxed its control over the kinds of goods and services to be produced, as well as their quantities, but private business owners failed to capitalise as they had to deal with taxes, dishonest officials and a poor infrastructure
* Thus, they lost their interest in starting their own business
* The soviet industry was also far too weak, leaving too many unprofitable enterprises that needed government support, leading to shortages of common items like food and shoes
* **Weakness of Soviet economy and failure of the reforms to revive the economy ->USSR no longer could compete with the USA/ continue the arms race -> Gave up competition with the USA -> Adopted the policy of new thinking -> Improved relations between USSR and USA -> End of Cold War**

#### Political

* Perestroika also tried to introduce political reforms, to renew the political system by allowing different views to be heard and to improve the effectiveness of policies by incorporating such views
* They also wanted to renew political leadership by allowing new leaders to be elected
* Elections within the communist party, Elections for the congress of people's deputies, and weakening the communist party by separating the party bodies form the government bodies
* This would let reformers rise to power, and give them the power to change the system
* However, there was a rise in opposition such as Boris Yeltsin, and a rise in separatist movements in the soviet republics, and they wanted to leave the USSR
* They weakened the control of the communist party, and made them powerless to stop reforms as they were too weak
* **Reforms -> Forces of opposition and nationalism that could not be contained -> Collapse of the USSR -> USA was the only superpower left -> End of superpower competition -> End of cold war**

### New thinking

#### End of the arms race

* Reagan and Gorbachev met in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1986 to discuss nuclear disarmament issues, and both sides were surprised by the sacrifices each was now willing to make towards nuclear disarmament
* They established good will that was lacking after the abandonment of detente, and laid out the groundwork for subsequent treaties and discussion on nuclear disarmament
* The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty signed in december 1987, where both agreed to remove the mobile intermediate-range nuclear missile deployed in Europe as a result of Able Archer 83.
* **New thinking -> Arms reduction -> Removed source of tension -> No more mutually assured destruction -> Both superpower blocs stopped being hostile to each other -> End of cold war**

#### De-ideologization

* The USSR gave up ideological competitions, allowing its satellite states to choose its own government and economy, and the USSR was to withdraw form eastern Europe
* The USSR would not intervene in other countries to support communist revolutions or regimes
* Gorbachev withdrew Soviet troops from Afghanistan by February 1989, signalling to the USA that they had given up the ideological basis for competition between communism and capitalism
* **Removed competing ideology -> Removed the basis for the cold war -> One side gave up competition -> Cold war ended**

### **Breakaway of the satellite states**

* Gorbachev emphasized each countries right to choose its political and economic system in his address to the UN
* This speech signalised the abandonment of the Brezhnev doctrine, meaning that the USSR would not interfere in the affair of its allies such as the suppression of the Hungarian Uprising or Prague Spring
* The various Eastern European Communist governments collapsed under the pressure from popular uprisings
* Poland saw a peaceful transition after Solidarity defeated the Communist party in elections
* Romanian government was overthrown in an violent uprising
* **Lifting of Brezhnev Doctrine -> USSR gave up its control over the satellite states -> eastern europe gave up communism -> No longer competing with the USA to spread its influence and defend its sphere of influence -> Improvement in relations between USA and USSR -> End of cold war**

### Disintegration of USSR

* The Impacts of Gorbachev's political policies left the USSR with no sphere of influence, opposition, and the economy did not recover, and the republics wanted to break away
* The government was powerless to stop reforms
* Hardliners within the communist party were increasingly alarmed that Gorbachev was conceding too much to the USA, and that their own power was being threatened
* Launched the August 1991 coup against Gorbachev, but was unsuccessful due to opposition form Yeltsin, who viewed them as a greater threat than Gorbachev
* Yeltsin had the support of Runnin military officers and pro-democracy supporters, and with this overwhelming support, he suspended the communist party of the USSR, the only force that was holding the USSR together
* The Soviet republics signed the Belavezha accords, agreeing to dissolve the USSR
* Gorbachev resigned as president of the USSR, dissolving it and the cold war came to an end
* **Reforms -> Forces of opposition and nationalism that could not be contained -> Collapse of the USSR -> USA was the only superpower left -> End of superpower competition -> End of cold war**
