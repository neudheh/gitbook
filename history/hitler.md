# ðŸª– Hitler

## Reasons for the rise of Hitler

### Constitution and proportional representation

* A system of proportional representation was in place to vote for members of the Reichstag
  * People voted for a party rather than specific candidates
  * Parties gained seats based on the number of votes won
  * Fair and democratic but led to a high degree of fragmentation in government
  * Too many small competing parties without any gaining a majority
* Coalition governments
  * All the particles came together to form a coalition government
  * A number of parties had extreme ideas and were not willing to compromise
  * There were also frequent changes in government as it kept breaking up
* During the Great Depression, the Weimar Government was unable to come up with effective policies to deal with the problems of the Great Depression
* **Proportional representation -> In ability of various parties to agree on a common course of action -> Ineffective decision making -> Weak Weimar government  -> People supported the Naszis instead**

### **Weak support**

* In order to put an end to WWI, the Weimar Government signed the TOV, admitting that Germany had to pay full responsibility for the war
* This angered the Germans who saw signing the TOV as an act of betrayal by the Weimar Government
* Germans were also not used to the system of parliamentary democracy, and wanted a return to authoritarian rulers under constitutional monarchy
* Hence, the Weimar Government found it difficult to get the support of the locals
* Left and right winged parties tried to overthrow the Weimar Government
* Kapp Putsch where right-winged nationalists assassinated 300 politicians before the revolt was crushed
* **Weak support -> Could not deal with revolts effectively -> Weak Weimar Government -> Rise in support for Hitler**

### Hyperinflation

* In order to purchase foreign currency to pay for the reparations, the Weimar Government mass printed bank notes
* The value of the currency decreased drastically, leading to hyperinflation
* The prices of goods skyrocketed,and the savings of the Germans become practically worthless, resulting in widespread poverty
* The government was unable to stop the french invasion of Ruhr and asked for workers to adopt passive resistance against the invasion
* The government had to continue paying workers, which worsened hyperinflation and brought the economy to the brink of collapse
* **Hyperinflation -> Ineffective policies -> Mass poverty -> Weak Weimar Government -> Supported Hitler instead -> Rise in support for Hitler**

### The Great Depression

* The outbreak of the Great Depression in 1929 has a serious impact on Germany's economy and the Weimar republic
* It caused the USA to recall its loans that it had extended to Germany during the mid-1920s and this led to the closure of banks and factories, causing very high unemployment
* Unemployment had reached 6 million by 1931
* This affected Germany very badly and caused a period of chaos
* The Weimar Government was heavily criticized for not being able to deal with the problems that came with the depression&#x20;
* **People turned to the Nazis -> Claimed to be able to solve the economic problems -> INcrease in support of the nazis -> Increases the popularity of their extremist position as they claimed they could solve the problems of the Great Depression and offered convenient scapegoats to blame for it**

### Nazi Ideology

* Provided an illusion of order
* Hitler claimed that he could solve the country's problems
* Blamed groups like the Jews for the country's problems
* Attractiveness of the 25 points program
  * Abolition of TOV
  * Union of Germany and Austria
  * Allowing only 'true' Germans to live in Germany
  * Nationalisation of Large businesses
  * Increase of old age pension
  * Establishment of a strong central government
* **Caused people to turn to the Nazis who claimed they were able to solve their problems and make Germany great again -> Increase in popularity -> Increased influence -> Weimar politicians needed the Nazis in order to pass their laws -> Led them to offer the role of chancellor to Hitler -> Rise to power**

### Charisma and Oratorical Skills

* He is a powerful speaker and communicator with a strong belief in himself
* He believed that it was his mission to rule not only Germany, but the world
* Excellent orator as he prepared and practised his speeches, a master at gauging the mood of the audience, had incredible energy making 3-4 speeches a day and appeared sincere to the people
* Made beer hall speeches where people were at ease and easily swayed, he started his speeches calmly and logically, and began to rant and rave as the audience got drunk
* Addressed the people's concerns as he knew the concerns of the people, and used the November criminals, communists and the Jews as scapegoats for Germany's woes
* **Appeared attractive to the Germans -> Increase in popularity -> Increased influence -> Weimar politicians needed Nazi support in order to pass laws -> Led them to offer Hitler the position of Chancellor -> Rose to power**

### Exploitations of the fears of communism

* As the Weimar Government became increasingly unstable, Germans turned to either radical right or left wing parties
* Nazis played up the threat of communism cleverly using propaganda
* Gained the support of the middle class and the rich as they wanted an anti-communist government
* With strong financial support, Hitler was able to build up the SA, which he used to break up communist meetings and fight them
* **This led to the perception of better the Nazis than the communists -> let Hindenburg agree to let hitler take the role of chancellor -> rose to power**

### Skillfulness at making deals with politicians

* In the November 1932 elections, despite rising popularity, the Nazis failed to get a majority of seats in the Reichstag
* Their share of votes fell from 230 - 196 seats
* Hindenburg and Franz von papen needed support in the Reichstag to pass laws, but they did not have enough, hence they were passing laws under article 48
* Hitler was then invited to be chancellor, as they thought they he could get the support they needed, and they could control him by dominating the cabinet with conservatives, leaving only 3 Nazis in it, keeping policy making in their hands
* **Hitler's ability to make deals with politicians -> Gained the position of chancellor -> Rose to power**

### Reorganisation of the Nazi Party

* Increasing party membership
  * Established local Nazi Parties, increasing party membership
  * Set up youth organisations
  * Created the Hitler youth in 1920s, and had 100,000 members by 1933
* Establishing the SA and SS
  * Set up the SA in 1921 as the Nazi's paramilitary organisation
  * Broke up Communist party meetings, gaining the support of anti-communists
  * Broke up strikes, gaining the support of big industrialists
  * Set up the SS as Hitler's elite personal bodyguard
  * Portrayed the SS and SA as militaristic
* Nazi Propaganda
  * Joseph Goebbels was appointed to be in charge of Nazi propaganda
  * Appealed to people's emotions rather than intellect
  * Portrayed Nazis as a strong party united behind one leader
* **Improved organisation -> Could gain much popularity and support -> Increased in support for the Nazi party -> Led to Hindenburg appointing Hitler as chancellor to gain support for his laws -> Rose to power**

## Political impact

### Reichstag fire (February 1933)

* Only 3/11 of the cabinet ministers were Nazis and he had to compete with the communists for political power
* The Reichstag Fire of 27 February 1933, was when Marinus van der lUbbe, a dutch communist, was arrested and accused for being part of a communist conspiracy
* He was arrested along with several communist leaders
* They were charged with arson and attempting to overthrow the government
* Hitler saw this as an opportunity to deal with his strongest rivals
* He convinced Hindenburg to invoke emergency powers and sign the Reichstag Fire decree
* This allowed hitler to suspend civil liberties and the freedom of the press and assembly in public
* Communists were arrested and their newspapers were shut down allowing the Nazis to eliminate their main opponents
* **Reichstag fire -> removed communists -> dismantled Germany's democratic institutions and no longer dependent on it to stay in power -> Could no longer be voted out through elections -> Consolidated his power**

### **Enabling act (March 1933)**

* In the March 1933 elections, the Nazis won 44%, and with the support of another small right-wing party, the Nazis now had a majority in the Reichstag
* Hitler planned to pass the enabling act, which would give him a great deal of power
* He could pass laws without the President's approval
* On 23 March, when the Enabling act was to be voted on, SS and SA men surrounding the building where the vote was to be taken place, and only allowed Nazis and their supporters into the building
* The enabling act was therefore passed
* The communist party and the Social Democratic Party were banned from taking part in any future elections
* **Enabling act -> Removed political opponents -> dismantled Germany's democratic institutions and no longer dependent on it to stay in power -> Could no longer be voted out through elections -> Consolidated his power**

### **One Party Rule (July 1933)**

* On 14 July 1933, Hitler passes a law making the Nazi Party the only legal political party in Germany
* Hitler was now in charge of a one-party-state within months of coming into power
* There was nothing that anyone, even president Hindenburg could do, and Hitler was a legal dictator
* Nazi officials took charge of local governments in the individual states of the German federation
* Trade unions were dissolved and their leaders were imprisoned
* The SA and SS dealt brutally with anyone who stepped out of line
* Most of the Nazi's political opponents were either sent to concentration camps or fled Germany
* **One Party Rule -> Removed political opponents -> dismantled Germany's democratic institutions and no longer dependent on it to stay in power -> Could no longer be voted out through elections -> Consolidated his power**

### **Night of the long knives (June 1934)**

* As Hitler consolidated his power, it had been the SA which helped him disrupt the meetings of other political parties
* They had also enforced his will after he became chancellor
* There was nothing to suggest that Ernst Roehm, the SA leader, was anything but loyal to Hitler
* Others in the Nazi Party felt that he had become too powerful
* Army leaders viewed that the SA had become too powerful as Roehm talked rashly about taking over the army
* They conspired to convince Hitler that ROehm was a threat to him
* He made a\\\ pact with the army that if he removed Roehm and other SA leaders, the army would swear an oath of allegiance to him
* In June 1934, the SS arrested and killed Rohem and other SA leaders, along with other political opponents who had angered him
* An estimated 400 men were killed
* The power of the SA was broken and became subject ot the control of the SS< making them in a position of great power in Germany and widely feared
* **Night of long knives -> Removed threat within the Nazi Party, Loyalty of the army**

### **Creation of the Fuehrer position (August 1934)**

* Hitler sought to consolidate his power further upon President Hindenburg's death in 9134
* There were still some important conservatives like von Papen, who disliked the Nazis and wanted a return to constitutional monarchy
* The Weimar Constitution states that a President must be elected
* Hitler merged the powers of the President with those of the CHancellor and proclaimed himself Fuehrer, or supreme leader of the German people
* He now had the power to invoke article 48, which he could not when he was just a chancellor, and the enabling act left the powers of the President intact
* Hitler was now above the law
* **Creation of the Fuehrer position -> dismantled Germany's democratic institutions and no longer dependent on it to stay in power -> Could no longer be voted out through elections -> Consolidated his power**

## Economic impact

### Re-employment

* There were over 5 million unemployed people, and a major crisis in the farming sector
* Dr Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank and the Minister of Economic, helped to reorganise Germany's finances so that new jobs could be provided
* Schacht encouraged hitler to initiate public works programmes such as the building or roads, motorways (autobahnen) and public buildings
* The Nazis involved the Reich Labour Service, an agency to reduce unemployment
* **Public works programmes -> New jobs for workers -> More people employed -> Reduced unemployment -> Boosted economy**

### **Rise of big industrialists**

* Big businesses developed a close relationship with the Nazis as part of their efforts to make Germany self-sufficient
* Under the new plan of 1934, industries important to Germany were subsidised and imports were barred
* Production of important products such as oil, steel, coal and explosives increased
* Companies that produced these were given valuable government contacts to make these items, and in exchange they supported the Nazis
* A ban on trade unions also helped the big businesses as employers no longer had to worry about conflict with workers due to them being under the strict control of the government
* Goering's four year plan (1936) was to prepare Germany for war in 4 years
* The massive amounts the state spent on rearmament boosted the incomes of companies involved in the production of war materials
* These big companies made compulsory donations directly to the NSDAP
* Big industrialists thrived and their production of important products contributed to the boost in the economy, while the Nazis did not have to be concerned about the Party's finances, while strengthening their power and influence
* **Increased government spending on oil, steel, coal, explosives and armaments -> Production increased -> Self-sufficiency -> Boosted economy**

### **Control of trade unions**

* Abolishing trade unions was one of the first things HItler did when he became Fuehrer
* Workers were forced to join a workers' organisation controlled by the Nazis called the DAF, or German Work Front, which united employers and employees in a single body
* Workers were strictly controlled by the DAF, and were no longer allowed to strike or bargain for pay raises or better conditions
* They were given work books, in which employers made comments about them
* They needed the government's permission to change jobs, or were not allowed to change jobs at all in some industries
* There was a wage freeze on all workers, with their social security benefits greatly reduced, but their output needed to increase, and they worked up to 72 hours a week
* Prices were stabilized and there were fewer strikes
* **DAF -> Workers had to work longer hours and harder for the same pay -> Fall in standard of living -> High human cost -> Failure**
* **DAF -> Output increased -> Increased productivity -> Economy benefited**

### **Organising workers' leisure time**

* The Nazis realised the workers' support was vital and offered some benefits to placate them
* Nazi propaganda praised workers for playing such an important role in Germany's drive to become a great nation
* The DAF set up schemes such as 'Strength Through Joy' which provided cheap theatre and cinema tickets, organised courses and cultural and sports events
* Wanted to control leisure time, but these activities had a lot of appeal
* The state scheme by which workers could save 5 marks a week towards a cheap car, the KdF-Wagen, was also extremely popular, but no one got the car as the programme was interrupted by WWII
* The Beauty of Labour was set up to improve working conditions for workers, by improving conditions of factories, setting up washing facilities and low cost canteens
* Workers had to often indirectly pay for them, making it seem like they were designed to keep people at their workplaces
* **Organising workers' leisure time -> Workers' welfare improved up to 1939 -> Increase in the standard of living -> Success**

### **Militarisation**

* In 1935, the Nazis introduce conscription for the army, which reduced unemployment drastically ****&#x20;
* By 1939, there were 1.4 million men in the army
* This created many jobs as men were needed to make war materials, such as weapons, equipment and uniforms
* Hitler also decided that Germany needed a modern air force, the Luftwaffe
* This helped to boost the economy and provide employment
* **Militarisation -> New jobs for workers -> More people employed -> Reduced unemployment -> Boosted economy**

## Social impact

### Propaganda

* When Hitler came to power, the Nazi Party was the largest political party in Germany, but majority of Germans still did not support it
* To secure their hold onto power, the Nazis needed to convince their supporters to continue supporting them, and to win over more people to their point of view
* Hitler set up a Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and propaganda with Joseph Goebbels as its head
* Goebbels believed HItler was Germany's savior, and used every form of media to communicate this idea and make sure people were loyal to Nazi rule and beliefs
* He used propaganda to appeal to deep-seated German desires for national unity and order, and that their future under the Nazis would be bright
* Posters and portraits of HItler spread throughout Germany to brainwash the German people
* **Propaganda -> Sharp increase of nationalist sentiments among the German people -> Increasingly saw their future with the Nazis being safe and secure under Hitler ->Accepted the Nazis as their rulers -> Complied with their policies at the time -> Consolidated their power**

### **Censorship**

* Goebbels was also expected to make sure that any information hostile to the Nazi Party was kept away from the German people
* He set up the Reich Chamber of Commerce in 1933, and anyone that wanted to publish art, literature, music, radio, film and newspapers had to be a member
* Thus, the Nazis could censor anything the Germans read, watch or listen to
* There was a public book-burning event, where the Nazis ransacked libraries and burnt any books they found unacceptable
* Goebbels also closely monitored the editors of newspapers and the information they published
* Radios were also made affordable, but the Nazis controlled all the radio stations, so the only opinion heard on air was theirs
* Broadcasts of hitler speeches were repeated, and if anyone missed out, loudspeakers were to be put in public places
* Listening to a foreign radio station was punishable by death
* There was a lack of freedom of expression and ideas among the Germans
* **Censorship -> Germans could only hear the Nazi's opinons -> Could control public opinon to support Nazi policies -> Indoctrinated Germans to follow their lead -> Complied with their policies at the time -> consolidation of power**

### Rise of the Secret Police

* The Gestapo was the Nazi's secrete poliece force and came under the leadership of Himmer
* It was responsible for finding and removing threats to the Nazi Party as well as to the Nazi State
* By 1937, the Gestapo had unlimited powers of arrest, and people could be taken into custody based on suspicion and put into concentration camps without a trial
* They used torture, murder, arrests and dirty tactics such as blackmail to stifle opposition to Hitler
* **With powers to make arbitrary arrests and send people into concentration camps on mere suspicion -> Organised opposition to the Nazis was quickly eliminated -> Consolidated power**

### Persecution of Jews and Minority groups

* Once Hitler came to power, Germany's Jew suffered Terribly
* HItler made anti-semitism the core of his belids
* He blamed the Jews for all of Germany's ills, from their defeat in WWII, to TOV to the Weimar Government, hyperinflation and the Great Depression
* A vicious propaganda campaign was conducted against them, and Jews were portrayed as sly, cowardly and evil people, out to destroy German culture while the Germans were portrays as the honest, hardworking and brave master race
* Hitler encouraged the SA and SS to bully and mistreat the Jews
* He embarked on a systematic attempt to rid Jews of their rights and destroy them financially

* Jews were only allowed to sit on park benches and bus and train seats marked Jew
* The Nazis burned books written by Jews, and jews had their business and properties taken from them, and they were no longer allowed to practise their professions
* The Nuremberg Law passed in 1935, effectively excluded Jews from German society, and they were no longer allowed to be German citizens, or marry non-Jews
* Some wealthy Jews managed to leave Germany, but most had their passports restricted or even removed to prevent them from leaving

#### Night of broken glass

* In November 1938, a Nazi Diplomat was shot dead by a young Jewish bow in Paris
* Hitler used this as an excuse for ordering a campaign of terror to be unleashed on Jews in Germany and Austria, known as the Night of broken glass
