# Hitler

## Rise of Hitler

### Constitution and proportional representation

* Proportional representation as where people voted for a party rather than a specific candidate, and parties gained seats based on the number of votes won
* It was a democratic and fair system but resulted in a high degree of fragmentation in government
* Too many small competing parties without any party gaining a majority
* All the parties cam together to form a coalition government
* A number of parties had extreme ideas and were not willing to compromise
* The coalition government kept breaking up, leading to frequent changes of government
* There were 20 different coalition governments form 1919-1933
* Difficult to pass laws and thus, seen as weak by the German people
* Example: In 1929, the Weimar government was unable to come up with effective policies to deal with the problems of the Great Depression
* **Proportional representation -> Inability of several parties to agree on a common course of action -> Made them appear weak to the German people -> Rise in support of Hitler**

### **Lack of support**

* In order to put an end to WWI, the Weimar Government had to sign the Treaty of Versailles, admitting that Germany had to pay full responsibility for the war
* This angered the Germans who saw the signing of the treaty as an act of betrayal by the Weimar government, attributing to the unpopularity of the Weimar government
* Germans were also not used to the system of parliamentary democracy and wanted to return to authoritarian rulers under constitutional monarchy
* As such the Weimar government found it hard to gain the support of the locals, and this led to attempts by the left-winged and right-winged parties to overthrow the government
* Example: Kapp Putsch, where right-winged nationalists assassinated 300 politicians before the revolt was crushed&#x20;
* **Unpopularity of the Weimar government -> Cannot deal with revolts effectively -> Made it weak -> Rise in support of Hitler**

### **Hyperinflation**

* In order to purchase foreign currency to pay for the reparations from the treaty, the Weimar government mass printed bank notes
* The more money was printed, the more its value decreased, resulting in hyperinflation
* Prices of good skyrocketed, resulting in widespread poverty&#x20;
* Worsened by the French invasion of the Ruhr, when Germany failed to make a payment
* The Germans adopted a policy of non-cooperation, and workers went on strike so that there would be nothing for the French to take
* The government printed yet more money to pay striking workers and pay off some of its debt
* This worsened the hyperinflation and brought the economy to the brink of collapse
* **Hyperinflation -> Mass poverty -> lost the support of middle and lower-middle classes -> weak -> Rise in support of Hitler**

### Impact of the Great Depression on Germany

* The outbreak of the great depression was due to the stock market crash of 1929 in the New York Stock Exchange, affecting almost every country in the world
* Hit Germany particularly badly, because it was dependent on loans and investments from the USA
* When the USA suddenly recalled the loans and deposits from banks, Germany suffered an economic crisis, and in turn a social crisis
* This led to the closure of banks and factories, causing millions to lose their jobs
* Example: By 1932. 6 million people or 1/3 of the population were unemployed
* The Weimar government could not decide what course of action to take as no government had enough support in the Reichstag to pass laws
* Paul Von Hindenburg, the President at the time did not care for democracy and didn't use his emergency powers to take action
* **Wanted more decisive action -> Decline in support for moderate opinions -> Rise in support for more extreme parties like the Nazi party who claimed to be able to solve the Great Depression**

### Nazi ideology

* Provided an illusion of order
* Hitler claimed that he could solve the country's problems
* Blamed groups like the Jews for the country's problems
* Attractiveness of the 25 points program
  * Abolition of TOV
  * Union of Germany and Austria&#x20;
  * Allowing only 'true' Germans to live in Germany
  * Nationalization of large businesses
  * Increase of old age pension
  * Establishment of a Strong central government
* **Caused people to turn to the Nazis who claimed they were able to solve their problems and make Germany great again -> Increase in popularity -> increased influence -> Weimar politicians needed Nazi support in order to pass laws -> Led them to offer Hitler the role of chancellor-> rose to power**

### Charisma and oratorical skills

* Hitler was a powerful speaker and communicator with a strong belief in himself
* Believed it was his mission to rule not only Germany, but the world
* Excellent orator
  * Prepared and practiced his speeches&#x20;
  * A master of gauging the mood of the audience
  * Incredible energy, making 3-4 speeches a day
  * Appeared sincere to the people
* Addressed people's concerns
  * Knew the concerns of the people
  * Used 'November criminals', Communists and the Jews as scapegoats for Germany's ills
* Example: Hitler made many speeches in beer halls where people were at ease and easily swayed, starting his speeches calmly and logically, and beginning to rant and rave when the audience got drunk
* **Appeared attractive to Germans -> Increase in popularity -> increased influence -> Weimar politicians needed Nazi support in order to pass laws -> Led them to offer Hitler the role of chancellor-> rose to power**

### Fear of communism

* As the Weimar Government became increasingly unstable, Germans turned to either radical right or left winged parties
* Nazis played up the threat of communism by cleverly using propaganda
* Gained the support of the middle class and the rich as they wanted an anti-communist government
* With strong financial support, Hitler was able to  build a sizeable private army, the SA, which he use to break up communist meetings and fight them
* **This led to the perception of better the Nazis than the Communists, and led Hindenburg to agree to let Hitler take the role of Chancellor-> rose to power**

### Skillfulness at making deals with politicians

* The Nazis won less than 3% of the votes in the 1928 elections
* By 1930, they had won 37.3% making them the party with the most seats in the Reichstag
* In 1932, President von Hindenburg was  pressurized to agree to Hitler's demand for chancellor
* He was persuaded by Franz von Papen who thought that the conservatives could channel their support for Hitler into support for the policies of the cabinet
* It was hoped that Hitler could help the government control the communists
* Welcomed by the rich industrialists who then supported the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor
* Hitler was then appointed chancellor on 30 January 1933
* **Hitler's ability to negotiate political deals -> gained the position of chancellor -> rose to power**

  * SS was Hitler's elite personal body guard
  * Both were portrayed to be militaristic
* Nazi Propaganda
  * Joseph Goebbels was appointed to take care of Nazi propaganda
  * Appealed to people's emotions rather than intellect
  * Portrayed Nazis as a strong party united behind one leader
* **Improved organization -> able to gain much popularity and support -> increased influence -> Weimar politicians needed Nazi support in order to pass laws -> Led them to offer Hitler the role of chancellor-> rose to power**

## Political impacts

### Reichstag fire

* The Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933 was a significant event that played a great role in Hitler's consolidation of power
* Marius van der Lubbe, a Dutchman was arrested near the building, accused of being part of a communist conspiracy and arrested him along with several other leaders of the Communist party
* They were charged with arson and attempting to overthrow the government
* Hitler saw this as an opportunity to deal with his strongest rivals
* He made President Hindenburg invoke article 48 and convinced him to sign the Reichstag fire decree, suspending civil liberties such as freedom of the press and the freedom to assemble in public
* The SA arrested communists, broke up their meetings and shut down their newspapers
* Those who spoke against Hitler were also beaten up
* This greatly affected the election campaigns of other parties in preparation for the March 1933 elections
* **Reichstag Fire -> Removed communists  -> dismantled Germany's democratic institutions and no longer dependent on it to stay in power -> could no longer be voted out -> consolidated his power**

### Enabling act

* On 23 march, SA and SS men surrounded the building where the vote for the Enabling act was to take place, only allowing Nazi's and their supporters
* The Communist Party and Social Democrat Party were banned from takin part  in any future elections
* Greatly increased the political authority of Hitler

* Most of their opponents had been sent to concentration camps or fled Germany

### Creation of Fuehrer position

* There were some important conservatives like von Papen who disliked the Nazis and wanted a return to constitutional monarchy
* The Weimar constitution said that a president must be elected upon Hindenburg's death in 1934
* Hitler merged the powers of the president with those of the chancellor and proclaimed himself Fuehrer, or supreme leader of the german people
* Hitler now had the authority to invoke article 48
* With the enabling act leaving the powers of the president intact, Hitler was now above the law
* The German Army was made to swear a personal oath of allegiance to Hitler instead of the German constitution
* **Creation of Fuehrer position -> dismantled Germany's democratic institutions and no longer dependent on it to stay in power -> could no longer be voted out -> consolidated his power**

### Night of Long Knives

* As Hitler consolidated his power, it had been the SA which helped him disrupt the meetings of other political parties&#x20;
* They had also enforced his will after he became Chancellor
* There was nothing to suggest that Ernst Roehm, the SA leader, was anything by loyal to Hitler
* Others in the Nazi Party felt that he had become too powerful
* Army leaders viewed the SA had become too powerful as Roehm has talked rashly about taking over the army
* They conspired to convince Hitler that Roehm was indeed a threat to him
* He made a part with the army that if he removed Roehm and other SA leaders, the army would swear an oath of allegiance to him
* In June 1934, The SS then arrested and killed Roehm and other SA leaders, along with other political opponents who had angered him
* An estimated 400 men were killed
* The power of the SA was broken and became subjected to the control of the SS, making them in a position of great power in Germany and widely feared
* **Night of long knives -> Removed threat within Nazi Party, Loyalty of army**

### Rise of the Secret police (can be social)

* The Gestapo was the Nazi's secret police force and came under the leadership of Himmler

* By 1937, the Gestapo had unlimited powers of arrest
* People could be taken into custody based on suspicion and put into concentration camps without a trial
* Used torture, murder, arrests and dirty tricks such as blackmail to stifle opposition to Hitler
* **Powers to make arbitrary arrests and send people to concentration camps on suspicion -> organized opposition to the Nazis was quickly eliminated -> consolidated power**
* &#x20;**Rise of secret police -> Feelings of fear and hostility -> Climate of fear**
