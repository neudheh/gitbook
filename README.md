Hi, welcome to my notes, i'm typing in gitbook now because markup here is so much easier, and i'm wondering if i can export as markdown to upload later&#x20;

my subject combi is phys + chem + core geog + elective history so these notes may or may not help you

personally i think my ss notes and my physics notes are the only good ones sooooo :p

by the way, the ones in bold for my humanites (SS/ History) are outcomes and significance <3
