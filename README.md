Hi, welcome to my notes, i'm typing in gitbook

my subject combi is **phys + chem + core geog + elective history** so these notes may or may not help you

i took the O levels in 2022, and these notes may be totally out of syllabus for sec 1s and sec 2s, sec 3s may find use in them

personally i think my ss notes and my physics notes are the only good ones sooooo :p

**please also do not circulate my notes**, i used a lot of resources from the textbook, and a lot from teacher's notes, and this may or may not be copyrighted, idk

keep it within ahs and don't let the teachers know ya

i have a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes, these notes were done at the crack of dawn or at midnight, or even after an exam, please excuse them

also, please mostly use this notes on a laptop, or your PLD, or your iPad, i don't know why but my notes aren't really mobile friendly

please do not use my notes as the only resource, please refer to your textbook/ teacher's notes, and maybe even make your own  <3

use one of the most important history skills to cross reference to your textbook/ teacher's notes, to see if what i'm saying checks out

i will not cover things like skills (dot-and-cross diagram, writing chemical equations) most of the time, but i will occasionally.&#x20;

if i don't cover the skills needed for those, please, go and refer to your resource book/ teacher's notes, or even book a consult

lastly, during O-levels i decided to give up on 4 chapters of history: Outbreak of WWII in europe, Defeat of Germany in WIII, Outbreak of WWII in Asia pacific, Defeat of Japan in WWII

these chapters are quite straightforward, and you can usually use the teacher's notes to get the outcome and significance you need, i only gave them up due to a lack of time, and usually the essay questions for unit 2 are quite....bad.

i'm so sorry Mr Tan, but i swear i'll do well for the cold war essay ok

All the best for your upcoming exams, and I hope these notes push you to an A1!

by the way, the ones in bold for my humanities (SS/ History) are outcomes and significance <3
