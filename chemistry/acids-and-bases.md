# ðŸ§ª Acids and bases

## Acids

* An acid is a substance that produces hydrogen ions when dissolved in water

### Physical properties

* Have a sour taste
* Turn blue litmus paper red
* Has a pH of 0-6
* Conducts electricity due to its moving ions
* In water, acids dissociate/ ionize to produce hydrogen ions which are responsible for its acidity

### Basicity

* The maximum number of hydrogen ions produced by one molecule of pure acid in water is called the basicity of the acid
* HCl is a monobasic acid as for every 1 mole of HCl, 1 hydrogen ion is produced in water
* $$H_2SO_4$$â€‹is a dibasic acid as for every 1 mole of $$H_2SO_4$$â€‹, 2 hydrogen ions are produced in water
* $$H_3PO_4$$â€‹is a tribasic acid as for ever 1 mole of $$H_3PO_4$$â€‹, 3 hydrogen ions are produced in water

### Strength

* The strength of an acid refers to the extent to which the acid molecule dissociates/ ionizes when dissolved in water
* A strong acid is an acid the fully ionizes in water to produce a lot of hydrogen ions
* A weak acid is an acid that partially ionises in water to produce few hydrogen ions

### Concentration

* Concentration refers to the amount of acid/ alkali that is dissolved In a solution
* An acid solution can be diluted or concentrated
* The concentration of an acid can be increase by adding more acid to the solution or decreased by adding more water to the solution

### Reactions

* Acids + reactive metal -> salt + hydrogen gas
  * $$2HCl(aq) + Mg(s) \rightarrow Mg^{2+}(aq)+H_2(g)$$
* Acids + carbonate -> salt + carbon dioxide gas + water
  * $$2HCl(aq) + MgCO_3(s) \rightarrow MgCl_2(aq) + CO_2 (g) + H_2O(l)$$â€‹
* Acids + bases -> salt + water
  * $$2HCl(aq) + Mg(OH)_2 \rightarrow MgCl_2(aq) + 2H_2O(l)$$
  * $$2HCl(aq) +MgO(s) \rightarrow MgCl(aq) + H_2O (l)$$
