# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ”¬ Acids and Bases

## Acids

* An acid is a substance that produces hydrogen ions when dissolved in water

### Physical properties

* Have a sour taste
* Corrosive, can burn the skin
* Turns blue litmus paper red
* Has pH value of 0 - 6.9
* Conduct electricity due to its moving ions

### Role of water

* In water acids dissociate/ ionize to produce hydrogen ions which are responsible for its acidity

### Basicity

* The maximum of hydrogen ions produced by 1 molecule of pure acid in water is called its basicity
* Monobasic - For every 1 mole of $$HCl$$â€‹, 1 hydrogen ions is produced in water
* Dibasic - For every 1 mole of $$H_2SO_4$$, 2 hydrogen ions are produced in water
* Tribasic - For every 1 mole of $$H_3PO_4$$, 3 hydrogen ions are produced in water
* For the same volume and concentration of acid, more volume of product will be obtained when the basicity of acid is higher

### Strength

* The strength of an acid refers to the extent to which the acid molecules dissociates/ ionises when dissolved in water
* A strong acid is an acid that fully/ completely ionises in water to produce a lot of hydrogen ions
* A weak acid is an acid that partially ionises in water to produce a few hydrogen ions
* Strength cannot be changed, a strong acid will be a strong acid whether it is dilute or concentrated, and a weak acid will be a weak acid whether it is dilute or concentrated

### Concentration

* The concentration of an acid refers to the amount of solute that is dissolved in 1 $$dm^3$$â€‹ of the solution
* Acid solutions can be diluted or concentrated
* Can be increased by adding more solute or decreased by adding more solvent

### Reactions

* Acids + Reactive metal -> Salt + Hydrogen gas
  * $$2HCl (aq) +Mg(s) \rightarrow MgCl (aq) + H_2 (g)$$â€‹
  * Metals like copper, silver and gold do not react with acids as they are unreactive
  * Metals like lead and calcium may produce an insoluble layer around the metal that can prevent the metal from further reacting with the acid
* Acids + Carbonates -> Salt + Water + Carbon dioxide gas
  * $$2HCl(aq) + MgCO_3(s) \rightarrow MgCl_2 (aq) + CO_2 (g) + H_2O(l)$$â€‹
* Acids + Bases -> Salt + Water
  * $$2HCl (aq) + Mg(OH)_2 (s) \rightarrow MgCl_2 (aq)  + 2H_2O (l)$$â€‹

## Bases

* Bases are metal oxides and hydroxides
* Alkalis are substances that produce hydroxide ions when dissolved in water
* Soluble bases in water are alkali

### Physical properties of alkalis

* Bitter taste, feel soapy
* Turn red litmus paper blue
* pH value from 8-14
* Conduct electricity due to its moving ions

### Strength of alkalis

* A strong alkali fully/ completely ionizes in water to produce a lot of hydroxide ions
* A weak alkali partially ionizes in water to produce a few hydroxide ions

### Reactions

* Alkali + Ammonium salts -> Salt + Ammonia gas + water
  * $$NaOH (aq) + NH_4Cl \rightarrow NaCl (aq) + NH_3 (g) + H_2O (l)$$
* Alkali + Some aqueous salts -> Metal hydroxide + aqueous salts (QA!!)
  * $$2NaOH(aq) + CuSO_4 (aq) \rightarrow Cu(OH)_2 (s) + Na_2SO_4 (aq)$$
* Base/ Alkali + Acids -> Salt + Waterâ€‹
  * $$2HCl (aq) + Mg(OH)_2 (s) \rightarrow MgCl_2 (aq)  + 2H_2O (l)$$â€‹

### Liming soil

* In soils that are too acidic, quicklime ($$CaO$$â€‹) or  Slate lime ($$Ca(OH)_2$$â€‹) is added to neutralise the excess acid, known as liming the soil
* It is important because it affects the growth and development of the plants and variety
* Must not add too much acid, if not it may become unsuitable for plant growth

## Indicators

* Indicator are dyes or mixtures of dyes which change colour when acids or alkalis are added to them

### Common indicators

| Indicator              | Range at which it changes colour | Colour change                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Methyl Orange          | 3-5                              | Red -> Orange -> Yellow          |
| Screened Methyl Orange | 3-5                              | Violet -> Grey -> Green          |
| Litmus solution        | 5-8                              | Red -> Purple -> Blue            |
| Bromothymol Blue       | 6-8                              | Yellow -> Green -> Blue          |
| Phenolphthalein        | 8-10                             | Colourless -> Colourless -> pink |

### pH scale

* The pH scale is a set of number form 1-14 which is used to indicate whether a solution is acidic alkaline or neutral
* Low pH - High concentration of hydrogen ions
* High pH - Low concentration of hydrogen ions/ high concentration of hydroxide ions

### Universal indicator

* The universal indicator changes according to the strength of the acid

| pH value | Colour         | Common chemicals                             |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0-2      | Red            | Strong acids ($$HCl, H_2SO_4, HNO_3$$â€‹)      |
| 3-6      | Orange/ Yellow | Weak acids ($$CH_3COOH, H_2CO_3, H_3PO_4$$â€‹) |
| 7        | Green          | Pure water, most salts                       |
| 8-11     | Blue           | Weak alkali ($$NH_3. H_20$$)â€‹                |
| 11-14    | Purple         | Strong alkali ($$NaOH, KOH$$â€‹)               |

* A pH meter can precisely determine the pH of a solution

### Reactions tests

* React the same volume and concentration of different acids with the same mass of metal/ carbonate
* Measure and record the volume or gas produced in a fixed period of time, or the time taken for the same volume of gas to be produced
* The acid that produces more volume of gas within a fixed time is the strong acid while the one that produced a lesser volume of gas within a fixed time is the weak acid, or the one that took a shorter time to produce the same volume of gas is the stronger acid while the one that took a longer time to produce the same volume of gas is the weaker acid
