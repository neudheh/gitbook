# âš› Ionic, covalent and metallic bonding



* For atoms to be stable, they need to have a fully-filled valence shell thus achieving a stable noble gas configuration
* Most atoms are not stable, and need to lose/ gain/ share electrons to achieve stability

## Ions

* Metal atoms lose their valence electrons to achieve stable electronic configuration to form positive ions, which are cations
* Sodium atoms loses 1 valence electron to form sodium ions
  * Sodium ion has a fully filled valence shell and hence a stable electronic configuration
  * Since the number of protons is more than the number of electrons in the sodium ion. the sodium ions has a positive charge
* Non-metal atoms gain electrons to achieve stable electronic configuration to form negative ions which are known as anions
* Chlorine atom gains 1 valence electron to form chloride ion
  * Chlorine ion has a fully-filled valence shell and hence a stable electronic configuration
  * Since the number of electrons is greater than the number of protons in the chloride ion, the chloride ion has a negative charge
* All ions are stable with fully filled valence shells, and are charged, with different number of electrons from their protons

## Ionic compounds

* When metallic elements react with non-metallic elements, the metal atom loses electrons to form positive ions while the non-metal atom gains electrons to form negative ions
* These oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other by strong electrostatic forces of attraction to from ionic bonds

### Drawing dot-and cross diagram

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The number of electrons lost by a metal atom is equal to the number of electrons gained by the non-metal atom
* Ions are represented by chemical symbol, square brackets and charges
* Draw valence electrons if question requires you to do so, if not draw the full electron shell
* Draw cations first, followed by anions
* Include legend for clear illustration, and different dots/cross for different elements

### Structure and bonding

* Ions of opposite charges are attracted to each other in a three-dimensional regular arrangement known as a crystal lattice
* Strong electrostatic forces of attraction hold the oppositely charged ions together

* (Structure) It is a strong giant ionic lattice structure
* (Bonding) with strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions

### Properties

* High melting and boiling point
  * It is a strong giant ionic lattice structure with strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions
  * During melting and boiling, a lot of heat energy is needed to overcome the forces of attraction in the giant ionic lattice structure
* Does not conduct electricity in solid state
  * In solid state, oppositely charged ions are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction in rigid lattice structure
  * Ions are unable to move to carry electric charges, thus unable to conduct electricity
* Conducts electricity in molten and aqueous state
  * In the molten/ aqueous state, the rigid lattice structure is broken down
  * The ions are able to move/ are mobile to carry electrical charges and conduct electricity
* Soluble in water
  * Water molecules weaken the electrostatic forces of attraction between the ions
  * Thus separating the positive ions from the negative ions
  * Causing the rigid lattice structure to break down and dissolve in water
* Insoluble in organic solvent
* Brittle

## Covalent bonding

* When two or more non-metal atoms react, their atoms share electrons to form a covalent bond
* The atoms may be of the same element of different elements
* The atoms come close together so their valence shells overlap, and share pairs of electrons in order to obtain a stable electronic configuration
* The substance is known as a covalent substance/ molecule
* Each pair of share electrons is a covalent bond

### Dot and cross diagram

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The number of valence electrons shared is the same&#x20;
* Draw valence electrons if question requires to do so, if not, draw the full valance shell
* After sharing electrons each atom must have a fully-filled, outermost electron shell
* Include a legend for clear illustration

1. Check the number of valence electrons present in the atom
2. Check the number of valence electrons needed for an atom to be stable
3. The number of valence electrons shared = number of valence electrons needed
4. Check the number of atoms involved in bonding
5. The atom that shares the most electrons will be in the middle
