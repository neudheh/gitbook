# ðŸ§ª Elements, compounds and mixtures

## Elements

* Elements are substances which cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means
* They are made up of one atom, or have molecules of the same types of atoms
* Can be classified into physical sates (solid/liquid/gas), or into their groups (vertical columns) or periods (horizontal rows), or into metals and non-metals and metalloids

* Metalloids are shaded in red, and metal are before the line while non-metals are after the line

## Compounds

* Compounds are a pure substance contain two or more elements that are chemically combined together in a fixed ratio
* Made up of two or more different kinds of atoms chemically joined together
* Can be classified into ionic and covalent compounds

## Mixtures

* Mixtures are an impure substance that consists of two or more substances physically combined together
* Made up of atoms of molecules of different kinds physically joined together
* Can be classified into element-element mixture, element-compound mixtures and compound-compound mixtures

## Molecuules

* A molecule is a **group of 2 or more atoms that are chemically combined together**
* There are 2 types of molectules: molecules of a element (group of similar types of atoms) and molecules of compounds (group of different types of atoms)
* Monoatomic means that is has only 1 atom, diatomic means that it has 2 atoms, triatomic means that it has 3 atoms and poly atomic means that it has 4 or more atoms

## Writing chemical formulas

* Chemical formula of a substance shows the symbols of atoms in the substance and the ratio of the atoms present
* Empirical formula shows the simplest ratio of the elements present
* Molecular formula shows the exact number of each element present in the molecule
* Structural formula shows how all the atoms are joined to each oterh, and each line between the atoms shows a covalent bond
* Balance the charges in the atoms to write the correct chemical formula
