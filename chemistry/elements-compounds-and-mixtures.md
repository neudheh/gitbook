# ðŸ§ª Elements, Compounds and Mixtures

## Elements

* An element is a substance which cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means
* Made up of one type of atom, or molecules of the same type of atoms
* Can be metal or non-metal

## Compounds

* A compound is a pure substance containing two or more elements chemically combined together in a fixed ratio made up of two or more different kinds of atoms chemically joined together

## Mixtures

* A mixture is an impure substance that consists of two or more substances physically combined together made up of two or more substances physically joined together made up of atoms or molecules of different kinds physically joined together

### Differences between compounds and mixtures

## Classification

### Elements

  * Groups (Vertical columns, correspond to the number of valence electrons) and periods (Horizontal rows, correspond to the number of electrons shells
  * Metals, Non-metals and Metalloids

### Compounds&#x20;

* Can be classified into ionic compounds (between metals and non-metals) and covalent compounds (Between non-metals)

### Mixtures

* Those at the left hand side of the periodic table are metals
* Those at the right hand side of the periodic table are non-metals

| Generally solid (except mercury)       | Generally gasses, volatile liquids or solids with low melting point |

## Molecule

* A molecule is a group of 2 or more atoms that are chemically bonded together
* 2 types of molecules: Molecules of an element (group of similar atoms) or compound (group of different atoms)
* Monoatomic: Single atoms
* Diatomic: 2 atoms of similar type
* Triatomic: 3 atoms of similar type chemically joined together
* Polyatomic: 4 or more atoms of similar type chemically joined together

_chemical formulas and common ions are skills by now, if you dont know them skill issue tbh_
