# 🏭 The atmosphere and the environment

## Composition of air

* 21% Oxygen
* 78% Nitrogen
* 0.97% noble gases (mostly argon)
* 0.03% carbon dioxide

## Separation of air

* Air can be come liquid air through cooling and compressions
* Liquid air can undergo fractional distillation to obtain nitrogen, argon and oxygen

## Air pollution

* **Air pollution** is a condition in which air contains a high concentration of chemicals that may harm living things and damage non-living things
* Caused by solid particles (fine particles such as soot, which is carbon) and harmful gases in the air ($$CO$$,$$SO_{2}$$,$$NO_{2}$$, Unburnt hydrocarbons, $$CH_{4}$$​, Ozone

### Sulfur dioxide

* The main source of sulfur dioxide is the combustion of fossil fuels, which contain sulfur impurities (e.g. coal) in power stations and factories
* Other sources are volcanic eruptions and the combustion of fuels such as petrol and diesel in car engines
* Colourless gas with a pungent smell
* Is a reducing agent, and can be tested for with acidified potassium manganate
  * If present, it will turn from purple to colorless
* Causes breathing difficulties
* Irritates the eyes and lungs
* Reacts with oxygen and rainwater to form acid rain which corrodes marble buildings

#### Acid rain

* Acidifies lakes and streams -> Aquatic plants and animals die
* Leaches nutrients from the soil, reacts with $$Al(OH)_{3}$$​ in soil to produce toxic produce$$Al^{3+}$$ -> Plants wither and die
* Reacts with metals and carbonates -> Marble and limestone buildings corrode; metal bridges are damaged

#### Flue gas desulfurization

* Removing sulfur form fossil fuels before burning is too expensive and difficult to minimise the effects of sulfur dioxide pollution
* Flue gas desulfurization is the use of neutralisation reaction to remove sulfur dioxide from the waste gases formed when the fossil fuels undergo combustion (cheaper)
* Since sulfur dioxide is an acidic gas, it can be neutralized when it reacts with solid calcium carbonate or a base like calcium oxide to from neutral calcium sulfite
* $$CaCO_3 (s) + SO_2 (g) \rightarrow CaSO_3 (s) + CO_2 (g)$$
* $$2CaSO_3 + O_2 \rightarrow 2CaSO_4$$

#### Reducing the effects of Acid rain

* Acid rain and cause the lakes and rivers to be acidic
* Can be neutralized through a process called liming
* The chemical sued to neutralize the acid is powered limestone (Calcium carbonate)
* But, it is expensive for farmers and its effects are only temporary

### Carbon monoxide

* The main source of carbon monoxide is the incomplete combustion containing fuels in power plants, factories or combustion engines of vehicles due to insufficient oxygen
* Causes respiratory difficulties
* Is toxic/poisonous

### Oxides of nitrogen

* Main source is when nitrogen combines with oxygen at high temperatures in the car engines
* Lighting activity
* At high temperatures, nitrogen combines with oxygen to from nitrogen monoxide (NO) $$N_2 (g) + O_2 \rightarrow 2NO (g)$$
* NO reacts with oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide ($$NO_2$$) $$2NO(g) + O_2 -> 2NO_2 (g)$$​
* Cause breathing difficulties
* Irritates the eyes and the lungs
* React with oxygen and rainwater to from acid rain which corrodes marble buildings

### Other pollutants

* Methane
  * When plant and animal matter decay
  * When rubbish in landfills decay
* Unburnt hydrocarbons
  * Released in car exhaust and chemical plants

### Ozone ($$O_3$$)

#### Ground level

* Formed in a photochemical reaction when nitrogen dioxide in the air reacts with unburnt hydrocarbons in sunlight
* Formed in a photochemical reaction between oxygen and UV radiation from the sun
* At ground level, it is a pollutant
* Causes serious damage to plants and discomfort to the nose, throat and chest
* Non toxic in small concentrations, but toxic in concentrations above 100 parts per million

#### In the Ozone layer

* Pale blue gas found in the upper layer of the atmosphere called stratosphere (20-50km above sea level)
* Acts as a shield to filter out harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun to protect man from the harmful effects of too much UV radiation
* E.g. skin cancer, eye damage, genetic mutation
* Depleting as it is being destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons
  * Contain the elements carbon, fluorine and chlorine
  * Widely used as propellants for aerosols and coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners, and manufacturing of packing foam
  * Fluorine gives stability to CFCs, making them persistent in the atmosphere (difficult to remove)
* Decompose into chlorine atoms in the presence of UV light, which react with ozone molecules making chlorine monoxide, destroying the ozone layer

### Catalytic converters

* Motorcars are fitted with catalytic converters to help remove air pollutants in vehicle exhaust gases
* When the hot exhaust gases pass over the platinum and rhodium catalysts, the harmful pollutants undergo redox reactions and are converted into harmless substances
* Carbon Monoxide (RA) is oxidised to carbon dioxide while nitric acid is reduced to oxygen $$2CO (g) + 2NO(g) \rightarrow N_2 +2CO_2$$​
* Unburnt hydro carbons are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water
* Toxic carbon monoxide is oxidized to non-toxic greenhouse gas carbon dioxide
* Harmful oxides of nitrogen which cause acid rain are reduced to harmless nitrogen

### Other measures

* Lightweight alloys used to make car bodies to improve fuel efficiency
* ​Switch to electric or hybrid electric vehicles to reduce exhaust gas emissions
* Alternative fuels such as hydrogen fuel where the products of combustion are harmless
* Switch to electric or hybrid electric vehicles to reduce exhaust gas emissions

## Carbon cycle

* The carbon cycle is the mechanism that maintains the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
* For atmosphere to maintain a constant amount of carbon dioxide, rate of removal of $$CO_2$$ = rate of return of $$CO_2$$
* Respiration produces carbon dioxide, as glucose in food we eat is converted into carbon dioxide and water, and energy is released $$C_6H_{12}O_2 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy$$
* Combustion of fuels like methane releases carbon dioxide
* Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when green plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen in the presence of sunlight $$6CO_2 (g) + 6H_2O (l) \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$
* essentially the reverse of respiration

### Greenhouse effect

* Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane) trap/ absorb the heat energy radiated back from the surface of the earth to prevent heat from escaping into the atmosphere
* Carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels
* Methane from the bacterial decay of vegetation

### Global warming

* Activities like the burning of fossil fuels and large-scale cutting down of forests are causing greenhouse gases, especially $$CO_2$$ to build up rapidly in the atmosphere
* Carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere at a higher rate than photosyntesis can remove the excess gas
* The effect of $$CO_2$$ build up leads to an increase in the Earth's average temperature, known as global warming
* Melting of large quantities of ice caps in the north and south poles, resulting in sea level rise, leading to floods in low-lying regions
* Decrease in crop yields world-wide as areas covered by vegetation may be deserts
* Rapid evaporation of water from the Earth's surface, resulting in released of dissolved carbon dioxide in oceans further adding to greenhouse effect
* More occurrences of unusual weather conditions
