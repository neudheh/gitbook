# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ”¬ Salts

* Salts are chemical compounds formed by the replacement of one or more hydrogen ions of acids by the metallic ion
* There are 2 types of salts: Acid salts (salt containing hydrogen ions) and normal salts (all the hydrogen ions are replaced)
* Monobasic acids cannot form acid salts

## Preparation of salts

### Precipitation

* For insoluble salts
* Add 2 aqueous salts to form insoluble salt

1. Add 2 aqueous salt solutions together, one in excess, until no more precipitate is formed
   * This is to ensure maximum yield where all the precipitate is formed
2. Filter the mixture to obtain the precipitate as residue
3. Wash the residue with a little cold distilled water
   * To dissolve acid and remove any soluble impurities from the other aqueous salt
   * To prevent the residue/ insoluble salt from dissolving in the water if the water is hot
4. Dry the salt in between sheets of filter paper to obtain pure dry salt

* Example: $$Pb(NO_3)_2 (aq) + Na_2SO_4 (aq) \rightarrow PbSO_4 (s) + 2 NaNO_3 (aq)$$â€‹
* Ionic equation: $$Pb^{2+} (aq) + SO_4^ {2-} (aq) \rightarrow PbSO_4 (s)$$â€‹

### Acid + Metal/ carbonate/ base

* To prepare soluble salts other than group I and ammonium salts

1. Add and stir excess metal/ insoluble base/ insoluble carbonate in acid
   * To ensure all the acid is used up/ has completely reacted
2. Filter the reaction mixture to remove excess unreacted metal/ insoluble base/ insoluble carbonate
3. Heat to solution to its point of saturation to obtain a saturated salt solution
4. Test for saturation by dipping a glass rod into the solution
5. Cool the saturated solution to let crystals form
6. Filter the solutions to obtain the crystals as residue
7. Dry the crystals between sheets of filter paper to obtain a pure dry salt

* Chemical equation: $$Zn(s) + H_2SO_4 (aq) \rightarrow ZnSO_4 (aq) + H_2(g)$$â€‹
* Ionic equation: $$Zn(s) + 2H^+ (aq) \rightarrow Zn^{2+} (aq) + H_2(g)$$â€‹

### Titration

* To prepare Group I and ammonium only

1. Pipette $$25.0cm^3$$â€‹ of soluble base/ carbonate into a conical flask to measure accurate volume of required solution, and add 2 drops of indicator&#x20;
2. Fill up the burette with dilute acid
3. Add dilute acid from the burette slowly into the conical flask until the indicator just changes colour, and record the volume of dilute acid used from the burette
4. The experiment is now repeated with the known volume of dilute acid, however no indicator is added&#x20;
   * To prevent the salt solution from being contaminated by the indicator
5. Heat the filtrate to its point of saturation to obtain a saturated salt solution
6. Test for saturation by dipping a glass rod into the solution
7. Cool the saturated solution to let crystals form
8. Filter the solution to obtain crystals as residue
9. Dry the crystals between sheets of filter paper to obtain pure dry salt

* **Evaporated to dryness for Group I salts only**
* Chemical equation: $$2NaOH (aq) + H_2SO_4 (aq) \rightarrow Na_2SO_4(aq) + 2H_2O (l)$$â€‹
* Ionic equation: $$H^+ (aq) + OH^ - (aq) \rightarrow H_2O(l)$$â€‹
