# üè≠ Crude Oil and Fuels

* A fuel is a substance that burns to produce heat energy
* Examples of fuels

* Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are the three main sources of energy used in industries today
* Known as fossil fuels
* Non renewable (Limited supply)
* Natural gas is 70-90% methane, and other alkane compounds - ethane, propane and butane
* From the decal of plant and animal waste
* Natural gas needs to be transported in liquid state as lesser space is required for transportation and storage
* To turn it into liquids, cool the gas to -162¬∞C

## Petroleum

* It is a dark brown viscous liquid mixture
* It must be separated using fractional distillation into many smaller useful fractions (fuel mixtures)

### The fractionating column

* The crude oil is heated and evaporates. The column is cooler at the top than at the bottom
* As the vapors rise up the column, they cool. Each fraction condenses at a different temperature
* The fractions with the lowest boiling point condensee and are removed at the top, those with the highest condense at the bottom

| Fractions                              | State at room temperature | Uses                                                 |

| Petroleum gas                          | Gas                       | Fuel for cooking                                     |
| Petrol (NOT THE SAME AS PETROLEUM GAS) | Liquid                    | Fuel for motorcars                                   |
| Naphtha                                | Liquid                    | Making chemicals such as plastics and alcohols       |
| Kerosene (Paraffin)                    | Liquid                    | Fuel for jet aircraft, fuel for heating and cooking  |
| Diesel oil                             | Liquid                    | Fuel for diesel engines of busses, taxis and lorries |
| Lubricating oil                        | Liquid                    | Lubricants for machines, waxes and polishes          |

* Down the column, the molecules increase in size
* As the molecules increase in size
  * The melting/ boiling point increases, as the  molecular size increases, there is an increase in intermolecular force between molecules, hence more heat energy is required to overcome these forces
  * The density increases
  * The viscosity increases (flows less easily) as the molecular size increases, there is an increase in intermolecular forces between molecules
  * The flammability decreases (Burns less easily) as the molecular size increases, the percentage of carbon in the mixture also increases

## Alternative fuels

* Alternative fuels are needed as fossil fuels are non-renewable and are limited in a quantity
* To conserve petroleum
  * Use alternative sources of energy that are renewable such as biofuel, which comes from plants. examples are ethanol and biodiesel
  * Use hydrogen as an alternative fuel for vehicles

### Advantages and disadvantages of ethanol

| Advantages                                                                                                 | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                |

| Renewable, while petrol is not                                                                             | Burns to produce half of the energy per mass of petrol, which means that it takes 2x as much as ethanol to produce the same amount of energy |
| Burns cleaner than petrol as it does not produce sulfur dioxide and produces less carbon monoxide per mass | Engines must be modified to run on ethanol                                                                                                   |
