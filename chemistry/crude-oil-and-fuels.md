# ⛽ Crude oil and fuels

* Fuels are substances that burn to produce energy

| Solid fuels                                                                                | Liquid fuels                                                                                                                                    | Gaseous fuels                                                                                                   |

* Fossil fuels
  * Coal - 30%
  * Petroleum - 30%
  * Natural gas - 20%
* These are the 3 main sources of energy used in industries today, known as fossil fuels
* They are non-renewable (supply is limited)
* Natural gas
  * Made up ot 70--90% methane $$(CH_4)$$​and other alkane compounds -ethane, propane and butane
  * Comes from the decay of plant or animal waste
  * Needs to be transported in liquid state so that lesser space is required for transportation and storage
  * Can be cooled into liquid at -162°C
* Petroleum&#x20;
  * Dark brown viscous liquid mixture
  * Separated using fractional distillation into many smaller fuel fractions
  * To test for mixture, test the boiling point of petroleum; if it is impure it will boil over a range of temperatures

## Fractional distillation

* Crude oil is heated and evaporates. The column is cooler at the top than at the bottom
* As the vapors rise up the column they cool, and each fraction condenses at a different temperature
* The fractions with the lost boiling point condense and are removes at the top, those with the highest condense at the bottom

| Fraction            | State at room temperature | Uses                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Petroleum gas       | Gas                       | Fuel for cooking                                     |
| Petrol              | Liquid                    | Fuel for motorcars                                   |
| Naphtha             | Liquid                    | Making chemicals such as alcohols, plastics          |
| Kerosene (paraffin) | Liquid                    | Fuel for jet aircraft, fuel for heating and cooking  |
| Diesel oil          | Liquid                    | Fuel for diesel engines of busses, taxis and lorries |
| Lubricating oil     | Liquid                    | Lubricant for machines; Waxes and polishes           |
| Bitumen             | Solid                     | Surfacing roads                                      |

* Down the column
  * Melting/ boiling point increases (because as size increases, there is an increase in intermolecular forces between molecules, hence more heat energy is required to overcome these forces)
  * Density increases
  * Viscosity increases
  * Flammability (how easy it is to light on fire) decreases

## Alternative fuels

* Alternative fuels are needed as fossil fuels are non-renewable, and hence are limited in a quantity
* One way to conserve petroleum is the use alternative sources of energy that are renewable such as biofuel, which comes from plants (e.g. ethanol and biodiesel
* Considered carbon neutral as the amount of carbon dioxide produced during the combustion of ethanol is balanced out by the taking in of carbon dioxide by the sugarcane during photosynthesis, and this does not affect the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

| <ul><li>Renewable while petrol is not</li><li>Burns cleaner than petrol as it does not produce sulfur dioxide and lesser CO per mass</li></ul> | <ul><li>Ethanol burns to produce half the energy per mass of petrol which means that it takes twice as much as ethanol to produce the same amount of energy</li><li>Engines must also be modified to run on ethanol</li></ul> |

* Use hydrogen as an alternative fuel for vehicles
