# Alcohols and carboxylic acids

## Alcohol homologous series

* General formula of $$C_nH_{2n+1}OH$$
* Same functional group of -OH
* Similar chemical properties

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* A functional group is an atom or a group of atoms responsible for the chemical properties of a compound
* E.g. all alcohols react in similar ways as they contain the same functional group, the hydroxyl (-OH) group

## Ethanol

* Ethanol is the most important member of the alcohol homologous series
  * Used as an alternative fuel
  * Known as a biofuel as it can be obtained form place, hence it is renewable
  * Sugarcane plant -> Glucose solution -> Ethanol
* Can be produced in two ways, fermentation and catalytic addition reaction of ethene with steam

### Addition of steam

* The double carbon bond, or c=c bond in carbon is extremely unstable and breaks open allowing other atoms to add to the carbon atoms, thus under going addition reactions
* Alkenes react with steam to produce alcohols
* $$C_2H_4 (g) + H_2O (g)\rightarrow C_2H_5OH (g)$$
* Conditions:
  * **Temperature of 300°C**
  * **Pressure of 60 atm**
  * **Phosphoric acid catalyst**

### **Fermentation**

* Fermentation is a chemical process where the catalyst yeast acts on glucose to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide
* Glucose solution -> ethanol + carbon dioxide
* $$C_6H_{12}O_6 (aq) \rightarrow 2C_2H_5OH (aq) + 2CO_2 (g)$$​
* Conditions
  * Glucose solution mixed with yeast as the catalyst
  * Temperature of about 37°C (the enzyme in yeast work best at around 37°C, if the temperature is raised beyond, the enzymes will denature and therefore unable to catalyze the reaction and fermentation will stop; if the temperature is too low, the yeast is inactive or the rate of reaction is too slow)
  * Absence of oxygen (air) (In the presence of oxygen, bacteria from the air oxidizes the ethanol into ethanoic acid, and the ethanol will turn sour if left exposed for a few days)
  * $$C_2H_5OH + O_2 \rightarrow CH_3COOH + H_2O$$
* The yeast is then filtered from the liquid mixture
* Ethanol can be obtained from the liquid mixture through fractional distillation

## Isomerism in Alcohols

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The position of the hydroxyl group (-OH) can vary
* The carbon chain can be straight or branched

## Reactions of alcohols

### Oxidation

* Alcohols undergo oxidation when it is heated with an acidified oxidizing agent which acts as the catalyst
* Requires heat
* Acidified potassium manganate (VII) solution (the acid used to acidify is sulfuric acid)
* A carboxylic acid and water is formed
* $$C_2H_5OH (aq) + 2[O](aq)\rightarrow CH_3COOH(aq) +H_2O$$​
* Color of Potassium magnate (VOO) changes from purple to colorless&#x20;
* Alcohol loses two hydrogen atoms and gains one oxygen atom

### Combustion

* Alcohols burn in excess oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water vapor
* $$C_2H_5OH(aq) + 3O_2 \rightarrow 2CO_2 +3H_2O$$

### Esterification covered&#x20;

### Uses of alcohol

* Used in alcoholic beverages (spirits)
* Used as fuel in motorcars by itself or mixed with petrol
* Used as a solvent to dissolve paints, varnishes, perfumes and deodorants as it can dissolve substances which are insoluble in water and it evaporates quicky (volatile)
* Undergoes oxidation to become a ethanoic acid for preserving food and making esters

## Carboxylic acid homologous series

* General formula of $$C_nH_{2n+1}COOH$$​
* \-COOH functional group
* Prefixes count the number of carbon atoms, even in the functional group, making methanolic acid $$HCOOH$$ and ethanoic acid $$CH_3COOH$$
* Used as flavoring (sour taste) and preservative

## Preparation

* [Oxidization of ethanol by acidified potassium magnate (VII) solution](alcohols-and-carboxylic-acids.md#oxidation)
* [Ethanoic acid is made industrially by the oxidation of ethanol in air with the help of enxymes in bacteria](alcohols-and-carboxylic-acids.md#fermentation)

## Reactions

* Are weak acids as they ionize partially in water to form a low concentration of H+ ions
* Low pH of 3-6
* Have acidic properties due to the H+ ions produced (1 mole of hydrogen per 1 mol of ethanoic acid)

### Reactions with metals, bases, carbonates

#### Metals

* React with reactive metals such as sodium, potassium and magnesium to give a salt and hydrogen
* $$2CH_3COOH(aq) +Mg(s) \rightarrow (CH_3COO)_2Mg + H_2$$

#### Carbonates

* React with carbonates to give salt, water and carbon dioxide
* $$2CH_3COOH(aq)+MgCO_3 \rightarrow H_2O(l) + CO_2 (g) + (CH_3COO)_2Mg$$

#### Bases

* React with bases to give a salt and water
* $$2CH_3COOH(aq) + CuO (s)\rightarrow(CH_3COO)_2Cu(aq) +H_2O$$

### Esterification

* Esther are sweet-smelling, colorless liquids that are insoluble in water
* Contain the -COO- functional group
* Esther are formed when a mixture of an alcohol and carboxylic acid is warmed together with a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid
  * Concentrated sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst for the reaction
* Remove the OH from the acid and the H from the alcohol and join them together
* Naming
  * Prefix of alcohol + yl + prefix of acid + anoate
* Used in preparation of perfumes due to their sweet fruity smell
* As artificial food flavorings due to their sweet fruity smell
* As solvents for cosmetics and glue
* Soaps
