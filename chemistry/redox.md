# ðŸ§ª Redox



* A substance has been oxidised when it
  * Gains oxygen
  * Loses hydrogen
  * Loses electrons
  * Increases in oxidation state after a reaction
* Reduction is the reverse of oxidation

| Oxidation                     | Reduction                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Gains oxygen                  | Loses oxygen                 |
| Loses hydrogen                | Gains hydrogen               |
| Loses electrons               | Gains electrons              |
| Increases its oxidation state | Decreases in oxidation state |

* Redox reactions are chemical reactions which involves the oxidation of a substance and the reduction of another substance

### Oxidation states

* Oxidation states is the charge an atom of an element would have if it existed as an ion in a compound
* This is true even if the compound is covalently bonded
* The oxidation state of a free element is always zero
* THe oxidation state of a simple ion is the same as the charge on the ions
* Group 1 elements have an oxidation state of +1 in compounds
* Group 2 elements have an oxidation state of +2 in compounds
* Hydrogen usually has an oxidation state of +1 in most compounds
* Oxygen usually has an oxidation state of -2 in most compounds
* The oxidations states of all the atoms or ions in a compound add up to zero, or in a polyatomic ions, the oxidations states of all the atoms is the same as the charged on the ion

## Oxidizing and reducing agents

* An oxidizing agent causes another substance to be oxidised by
  * Giving oxygen
  * Removing hydrogen
  * Accepting electrons
  * And is reduced at the end of the reaction
* A reducing agent causes another substance to be reduced by&#x20;
  * Removing oxygen
  * Giving hydrogen
  * Donating electrons
  * And is oxidized at the end of the reaction

### Test for oxidizing agents

* Add acidified potassium iodide, KI, to the unknown solution
  * A brown solution will be formed
  * The iodide ions are oxidised to iodine by the oxidising agent
  * $$2I^- (aq) \rightarrow I_2(aq) + 2e^-$$
* Dip a piece of starch-iodide paper into the unknown solutionâ€‹
  * The starch-iodide paper turns from white to blue
  * The iodide ions are oxidised to iodine by the oxidising agent, which then recs with the starch to give a blue colour

### Test for reducing agents

* \[For gasses] Place a piece of filter paper soaked with acidified potassium manganate(VII), $$KMnO_4$$â€‹, at the mouth of the test tube
  * Acidified potassium manganate(VII) paper turns from purple to colourless
* \[For solutions] Add acidified potassium manganate(VII), $$KMnO_4$$ to the unknown solution
  * The colour of acidified potassium manganate (VII) will turn from purple to colourless
* The manganate(VII) ions in $$MnO_4^-$$is reduced to Manganese (II) ion $$Mn^{2+}$$â€‹
* The oxidation state of Mn decreases from +7 in $$MnO_4^-$$â€‹ to +2 in $$Mn^{2+}$$
* $$MnO_4^- (aq) + 8H^-(aq) +5e^- \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 4H_2O$$â€‹
