# Macromolecules

* A polymer or a macromolecule is a very large molecule that is made up of a large number of small molecules (monomers)

## Addition polymerization

* Large numbers of unsaturated small molecules (monomers) join together to from a polymer or a macromolecule without the elimination of small molecules or atoms
* High pressure
* High temperature
* Catalyst

* Polyethene can be molded into different shapes
* Used to make toys, clingfilm, plastic bags, buckets

## Condensation polymerization

* A reaction where large numbers of small molecules with two functional groups join together to from a large molecule. Small molecules or atoms are eliminated during the reaction

### Polyamides

* Remove the OH form the acid, and the H/ Cl from the diamine, and join
* Have amide linkages CONH

### Polyesters

* Remove the OH form the acid, and the H/ Cl from the diol, and join
* Have ester linkage COO

### Uses

* Spun into threads, and used to make clothes, which are shrink proof and crease proof
* Easier to wash and dry
* Curtains, parachutes, fishing lines and sleeping bag

## Advantages and disadvantages

* Cheap
* Easily molded into various shapes
* Light, tough and waterproof
* Durable
* Non-biodegradable -> accumulate as they are not de composed by bacteria -> build up of waste and take up space at landfill sites
* Flammable -> fires can spread quickly and poisonous gases are produced
* Thrown into the sea -> mistaken for food by animals -> choke and endanger animals
* Clog up rivers and drains -> breeding ground for mosquitos
