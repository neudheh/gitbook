# ðŸ§ª Periodic table

* Elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number
* Groups form I - 0 are vertical columns and are equal to the number of valence electrons
* &#x20;Periods number 1-7 are horizontal rows and are equal to the number of electron shells
* Period one is hydrogen and helium
* Classified into
  * Main group elements, transition metals, lanthanides, actinides
  * Solid, liquids (Mercury and bromine), gases ($$H_2,F_2,O_2, N_2,Cl_2$$â€‹)

## Periodic trends

### Physical properties

* Electronic configuration
  * All elements in the same period have the same number of electrons shells
  * The number of valence electrons of elements in the same period increase progressively  by one across the period from left to right
* Metallic and non-metallic properties
  * Metallic properties tend to decrease across each period while non-metallic properties tend to increase across the period

### Chemical properties

* There is a gradual trend in the type of bonds formed by the elements in compounds from ionic to covalent bonds as we go across the period
* They form oxides which change from strongly basic to amphoteric to strongly acidic across the period

## Group trends

* The elements in a group have the same number of valence electrons
* Due to their similarity in the number of valence electrons, elements in a group have similar chemical properties
* Formulas of compounds formed by elements in the same group are similar&#x20;
* THere is a gradual change in physical properties of elements as we move down the group

## General trends down a group and period

* Ionisation energy is the amount of energy needed to remove the most loosely bound electron (valence electron) from an atom
* The higher the ionisation energy of an atom
  * The harder to remove the valence electron from the atom
  * The more stable is the atom
  * The reactivity of the atom to form another compound is lesser

| Atomic radius increases, as the number of electron shells decreases down a group, hence atomic radius increases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Atomic radius decreases, as there are the same number of electron shells across the periods, but the number of electron instances increases across the period, causing the electrostatic forces of attraction between the valence electrons and positive nucleus to increase, thus the valence electrons are held more tightly to the nucleus, hence atomic radius decreases                                                       |
| Ionisation energy decreases, as there is an increase in the number of electron shells. As the atomic radius increases, valence electrons are further away from the positive nucleus, and the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons decreases, and valence electrons are held less tightly to the nucleus, hence the valence electrons can be removed more easily | Ionisation energy increases as there is an increase in the number of electrons, but the number of electron shells stay the same. As the atomic radius decreases, valence electrons are close to the positive nucleus, and the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons increases, and valence electrons are held more tightly to the nucleus, hence the valence electrons are harder to remove |

## Group I elements - alkali metals

### Appearance

* Solids at room temperature
* Shiny and silvery when freshly cut or when clean. The high reactivity of these metals may cause the formation of a layer of oxide which makes the metals appear dull
* Malleable and soft, can be cut with a knife

* Good conductors of heat and electricity
* Low densities, float on water
* Low melting points compared to other metals, but high boiling points
* Compounds are white solids at room temperature and dissolve to form colourless solutions

### Chemical properties

* Lose their one valence electrons very easily -> Very reactive
* Powerful reducing agents
* Low ionisation energy

* React with chlorine to form metal chloride
* React with acid to form salt and hydrogen gas

### Trends

* Reactivity increases down the group
  * Size of the atom increases -> electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron decreases -> Easier to lose the valence electrons form bigger atoms -> reactivity increases
* Melting point decreases down the group&#x20;
  * More electron shells -> electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron decreases -> Lesser heat energy is needed to overcome
* Densities of the metals increase down the group

## Group VII elements - Halogens

  * Halogens undergo displacement reactions, where a more reactive halogen displaces a less reactive halogen from its halide solution

### Trends

* Elements get darker down the group
* Reactivity decreases down the group&#x20;
  * As the size of the atom increases, it becomes more difficult for the nucleus to attract one more electron
* Melting and boiling points increase down the group&#x20;
  * As the size of the molecule increases, the intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecule increases, and more energy is required to overcome these forces

### Group 0 elements - Noble gases

* Insoluble in water

### Trends

* Melting and boiling points increase down the group&#x20;
  * As the size of the molecule increases, the intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecule increases, and more energy is required to overcome these forces

## Transition elements
