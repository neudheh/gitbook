# ⚛ Atomic structure

## Atoms

* Atoms are the smallest particles of an element/ the fundamental unit of matter
* Consists of 3 sub-atomic particles: Proton, neutron, and electron
* Protons have a charge of +1 and have a relative mass of 1
* Neutrons have a charge of 0 and a relative mass of 1
* The proton and neutrons are found in the nucleus of an atom, and are known as nucleons
* Electrons have a charge of -1 and have a mass of 1/1840, which makes it negligible
* Electrons orbit around the center of the atom in electron shells
* The inner electron shell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons while the second and third shells can hold a maximum number of 8 electrons each

## Nuclide representation

* $$^a_bX$$​, where a is the mass/ nucleon number, and b is the atomic / proton number, and X is the chemical symbol of the element
* The proton (atomic)  number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
* The mass (nucleon) number is the number of protons and neutron in the atom)
* The number of neutrons can be calculated by taking the mass number - proton number
* Atoms are electrically neutral because the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons

## Isotopes

* Isotopes are different atoms of the same element which have the same number of protons, but different number of neutrons
* Have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons, but  have different physical properties&#x20;
* To calculate relative isotopic mass use the formula ($$M_1 \times \frac{P_1}{100}+M_2 \times \frac{P_2}{100}$$), where M is the Mass number of the isotope, and P is the percentage of the isotope

## Noble gases

* Group 0 elements (Helium, Neon, Argon) have fully-filled valence shells, which is known as a noble gas/ stable electronic configuration
* Elements which have noble gas electronic configurations are very stable and therefore unreactive, and are chemically inert
