# üè≠ Alkanes and alkenes

## Organic compounds

* Organic compounds are compounds containing the element carbon
* Can be organized by
  * Hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons
  * Homologous series
  * Number of carbon atoms

## Alkane homologous series

* A homologous series is a family of organic compounds with a general formula and similar chemical properties and showing a gradation of physical properties as a result of increase in the size and mass of the molecules
* The alkane homologous series has a general formula of $$C_nH_{2n+2}$$
*   The first four alkanes are Methane ($$CH_4$$‚Äã), Ethane ($$C_2H_6$$) Propane $$(C_3H_8)$$ and Butane $$(C_4H_{10})$$‚Äã

## Isomerism in alkanes

* Isomers are compounds with the same chemical properties and formula, but different structural formula and physical properties such as boiling points
* Butane has 2 isomers and Pentane has 3 isomers

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Important as straight chain alkanes ignite easily and burn readily (more explosive and react readily) , and if they are used as fuels in car engines, they ignite too early and explode, instead of burning gently like branch-chain alkanes
* Branched chain isomers are preferred over straight-chain alkane molecules, and enginves run better

## Reactions of alkanes

### Substitution

* Alkanes undergo substitution reaction with halogens in the presence of sunlight or UV light as a catalyst
* A hydrogen atom in the alkane molecules is substituted by a halogen atom
* Also called a photochemical reaction as sunlight acts as a catalyst, providing energy for the chlorine molecules to form chlorine atoms that attack the methane molecule
* naming formula of -/di/tri/tetra - chloro/bromo - alkane
* Fluorine would be too reactive and too violent and iodine would be least reactive and the reaction would be too slow
* Slow reaction as it is substituted one at a time

### Combustion

* Combustion or burning of alkanes in excess oxygen(air) produces carbon dioxide ($$CO_2$$‚Äã) and water vapor ($$H_2O$$‚Äã)
* Incomplete combustion occurs if there is insufficient supply of oxygen in air, producing carbon monoxide and soot (carbon)

### Cracking

* Cracking is defined as the chemical decomposition of a compound
* Catalytic cracking requires a temperature of 500-600¬∞C, and Aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide as a catalyst
* Used to meet the demand for petrol
  * Crude oil contains large alkane molecules which are high in supply and low in demand such as diesel
  * Cracking helps to produce smaller alkane molecules such as petrol which are low in supply and high in demand
* Used to make unsaturated straight-chain alkenes which are important petrochemical feedstocks for making plastics like polyethene
* Used to make hydrogen, which is an alternative to fossil duel and also can be used in the fuel cell, and in the Haber process to make ammonia

## Alkene homologous series

* General formula of $$C_nH_{2n}$$‚Äã

* Unstable as the C=C bond is unstable, which tends to break open allowing other atoms to add to the carbon atoms, and undergo addition reactions
* There is no methene, as a C=C bond is needed between carbon atoms

* Change the position of the double bond
* Branching

## Reactions

### Addition

* Addition reactions are reactions in which molecules of another element or compound add to the C=C bond of the unsaturated organic compound to form a saturated new compound

add the new element where the double bond was<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">
{% endhint %}

#### Hydrogen

* Alkenes react with hydrogen to produce alkanes
* $$C_2H_4 (g) + H_2 (g)\rightarrow C_2H_6 (g)$$
* Conditions:
  * **Temperature of 200¬∞C**
  * **Nickel catalyst**
* No visible reaction as both ethene and ethane are colorless gas
* Used to turn vegetable oil into fat like margarine

#### Bromine

* Alkenes react with aqueous bromine to produce bromoalkenes
* $$C_2H_4 (g) + Br_2 (aq)\rightarrow C_2H_4Br_2 (l)$$
* No conditions
* Aqueous bromine turns from brown to colorless

#### Testing for unsaturated compounds

* Alkenes and other unsaturated compounds react with bromine
* The brown bromine turns colorless
* Used to distinguish between alkenes and alkanes
* Alkanes do not decolorize the bromine water

#### Steam

* Alkenes react with steam to produce alcohols
* $$C_2H_4 (g) + H_2O (g)\rightarrow C_2H_5OH (g)$$
* Conditions:
  * **Temperature of 300¬∞C**
  * **Pressure of 60 atm**
  * **Phosphoric acid catalyst**

### Combustion

* Alkanes burn in air like alkanes
* Produce more soot than alkanes as they have a higher percentage of carbon by mass than alkanes, producing a smokier flame/ sootier

### Addition polymerization

* Alkanes undergo addition polymerization
* Addition polymerization is a reaction where unsaturated monomer join together without losing any molecules or atoms to make an addition polymer

### Foods and unsaturated compounds

* Vegetable oils are polyunsaturated, making it considered to be healthier to consume in food than saturated oils
* Margarine is made by reactive vegetable oil with hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst
* Unripe fruit produces a small amount of ethene which helps it to ripen
* Putting a ripe fruit together with unripe fruit will help the unripe fruit unripen faster
