<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sor_gas.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Set up the apparatus as shown and add 50cmÂ³ of 1 mol/dmÂ³ of aqueous hydrogen peroxide in the conical flask and stopper it
2. Measure and record the volume of oxygen gas produced in 60s
3. Repeat the experiment using 50cmÂ³ of 1 mol/dmÂ³ aqueous hydrogen peroxide and 1g of X as the catalyst. Measure and record the volume of oxygen gas produced in 60s
4. The experiment with the catalyst should produce a larger volume of gas in 60s
5. Filter the remaining mixture and dry the X used between filter papers. Weigh the mass of X to check its mass
6. The mass of X powder should be 1g as it so not consumed in the reaction

## Speed of reaction (temperature)

1. Using a measuring cylinder, transfer 20cmÂ³ of ammonium peroxodisulfate into a boiling tube. Measure the temperature of the ammonium peroxodisulfate with a thermometer and record this value in a table
2. Using another measuring cylinder, transfer 20cmÂ³ of 1 mol/dmÂ³ aqueous iodide ions and add it into the boiling tube containing 20cmÂ³ of 1 mol/dmÂ³ ammonium peroxodisulfate and add a few drops of starch solution and start timing immediately. Record the time taken for a blue-black solution to form
3. Wash the boiling tube and place another 20cmÂ³ of 1 mol/dmÂ³ ammonium peroxodisulfate in it. Place the boiling tube in a beaker of water, and heat the beaker with a bunsen burner
4. When the temperature of the ammonium peroxodisulfate reaches 80Â°C, remove the boiling tube from the beaker. Wait half a minute, measure the temperature and record this value. Then add 20cmÂ³ of 1 mol/dmÂ³ aqueous iodide ions and a few drops of starch solution. Record the time taken for a blue-black solution to form
5. Repeat steps 3-4 but heat the ammonium peroxodisulfate to about 70Â°C before removing the boiling tube form the beaker. Record the time taken for a blue-black solution to form
6. Repeat septs 3-4 by heating the boiling tube containing ammonium peroxodisulfate to 3 other temperatures. It is not necessary to heat the ammonium peroxodisulfate to these exact temperature, but the correct temperature must be measured half a minute after the tube is removed from the water. Record your values in the table below

| Temperatrure of ammonium peroxodisulfate/ Â°C | Time taken for blue-black solution to form/ s |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 80.0                                         |                                               |
| 70.0                                         |                                               |
| 60.0                                         |                                               |
| 50.0                                         |                                               |
| 30.0                                         |                                               |

From the table, refer to the data obtained to determine if an increases in temperature of ammonium peroxodisulfate by 10Â°C will cause the time taken for the blue-black solution to be halved

6. Repeat the experiment to obtain an average&#x20;
7. Repeat steps 2-6 with powdered copper (II) carbonate and zinc carbonate
8. The shorter the time taken for 30cmÂ³ of carbon dioxide gas to be collected, the less stable the metal carbonate is to heat, the less reactive the metal/ the greater the volume of carbon dioxide gas collected in 30s, the less reactive the metal

5. Repeat the titration until consistent results are achieved
6. Calculate the concentration of potassium manganate (VII) using the formula:\
   Mole ratio: $$2KMnO_4 = 5 H_2O_2$$â€‹\
   $$\frac{conc \char32 of \char32 KMNO_4 \times Volume \char32 of KMnO_4 \char32 obtained \char32 in \char32 step \char32 4}{Known \char32 conc \char32 of \char32 H_2O_2 \times 25cm^3}= \frac{2}{5}$$\
   $$conc \char32 of \char32 KMNO_4 = \frac{2 \times Known \char32 conc \char32 of \char32 H_2O_2 \times 25cm^3}{5 \times Volume \char32 of KMnO_4 \char32 obtained \char32 in \char32 step \char32 4}$$

{% hint style="warning" %}
For any titration planning question, DO NOT USE UNIVERSAL INDICATOR

This is because it is hard to determine the end-point

Use screened methyl orange/ thymol blue

## Mass of a water in a hydrated salt (carbonate)

### Method 1

1. Add a known mass of the sample to an excess of nitric acid. Collect and measure the volume of carbon dioxide produced

2. Find the mass of $$K_2CO_3$$â€‹
3. Subtract the mass of $$K_2CO_3$$â€‹ from the known mass of the sample, divide the mass of water by the known mass of sample S to find the percentage by mass
