## Speed of reaction (table, temperature)

1. Set up the apparatus as shown in the figure
2. Measure 25.0$$cm^3$$ of  1$$mol/dm^3$$ of ammonium peroxydisulfate (â€‹$$(NH_4)_2S_2O_8$$) into a boiling tube. Measure the temperature of $$c$$â€‹ with a thermometer and record this value in a table
3. Using another measuring cylinder to transfer $$25.0cm^3$$ of 1$$mol/dm^3$$â€‹ aqueous iodide ions and add it to the boiling tube containing 25.0$$cm^3$$of â€‹1$$mol/dm^3$$â€‹ of $$(NH_4)_2S_2O_8$$ and add a few drops of starch solution (indicator) and start timing immediately. Gently stir the mixture in the boiling tube with the thermometer and record the time taken for a blue-black solution to form (color of indicator)
4. Wash the boiling tube and place another 25.0$$cm^3$$ of 1 $$mol/dm^3 (NH_4)_2S_2O_8$$in it. Place the boiling tube in a beaker of water and heat the beaker with a bunsen burner
5. When the temperature of $$(NH_4)_2S_2O_8$$ reaches 80Â°C, remove the boiling tube form the beaker. Wait half a minute, measure the temperature and record the value. Then add 25$$cm^3$$â€‹ of 1 $$mol/dm^3$$â€‹ aqueous iodide ions and a few drops of starch solution (indicator) and start timing immediately. Record the time taken for a blue-black solution to form
6. Repeat steps 3-4 but heat the $$(NH_4)_2S_2O_8$$ to about 70Â°C before removing the boiling tube from the beaker. Record the time taken for a blue-black solution to form
7. Repeat steps 3-4 by heating the boiling tube containing the $$(NH_4)_2S_2O_8$$  to 3 other temperatures, and measure the temperatures half a minute after the tube is removed from the hot water. Record all your values in a table

(link to results)

* From the table, refer to the data obtained to determine if an increase in temperature of $$(NH_4)_2S_2O_8$$ by 10Â°C will cause the time taken for the blue black solution to be formed

## Speed of reaction (catalyst, using gas syringe and conical flask)

* Set up the reaction as shown in the diagram
* Add 50$$cm^3$$â€‹ of 1$$mol/dm^3$$ aqueous hydrogen peroxide in the conical flask and stopper it
* Measure and record the volume of oxygen gas produced in 60s
* The experiment with the catalyst used should produce a larger volume of gas in 60 seconds
* Filter the resulting mixture and dry the X (catalyst) used between filter papers, and wight the mass of X to check its mass
* The mass of X should be 1 gram as it is not consumed in the reaction

## Finding Mr of acids (Gas syringe and conical flask)

* Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram
* Measure 25.0$$cm^3$$ of HCl using a pipette/ measuring cylinder and transfer it into the conical flask
* Add $$Na_2CO_3$$in excess to the conical flask and stopper it quickly
* Measure and record the volume of the volume of carbon dioxide is constant
* Calculate the number of moles of carbon dioxide gas suing the formula: number of moles = volume of gas / 24 000 $$cm^3$$
* Using the mole ratio, the number of moles of HCl to $$CO_2$$â€‹ (2:1), calculate the number of moles of HCl using the formula: number of moles of CO$$_2$$â€‹X 2
* Hence, calculate the concentration of HCl used using the formula: number of moles of HCl/ volume of HCl used in dm$$^3$$

## Salts (Finding concentration of ions)

* Using a pipette/ measuring cylinder, measure out 25.0 $$cm^3$$ of the aqueous solution containing Cl- ions
* Add an excess of aqueous silver nitrate to the solution
* Filter the mixture and collect the residue of silver chloride (AgCl)
* Wash the residue of silver chloride and dry between sheets of filter paper
* Weigh the dried silver chloride
* Calculate the number of moles of silver chloride using the formula: number of moles of AgCl = mass of AgCl / Mr of AgCl
* Using the mole ratio, the numbe ro f moles of chloride ions to silver chloride is 1:1 based on the equation Ag$$^+$$(aq) + Cl$$^-$$(aq) -> AgCl (ss)
* Calculate the concentration of chloride ions present in the solution in mol/dm$$^3$$ using the formula: no of moles / volume of chloride solution

## Metals (reactivity of metals)

* Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram above
* Using an electronic balance, weigh 1g of powdered $$MgCO_3$$â€‹and transfer it into a dry boiling tube
* Stopper the boiling tube with the rubber bung attached to a graduated gas syringe
* Heat the metal carbonate strongly and start the stopwatch immediately
* Record the time taken for 30 cm$$^3$$of  carbon dioxide gas collected OR the volume of gas collected in 30sâ€‹
* Repeat the experiment to obtain an average
* Repeat steps 2-6 with powdered copper(II) carbonate and zinc carbonate
* The shorter the time taken for 30 cm $$^3$$â€‹of gas to be collected, the less stable the metal carbonate is to heat, the less reactive the metal OR the greater the volume of carbon dioxide gas collected in 30s, the less reactive the metal

## Redox

* Fill the burette with $$KMnO_4$$â€‹(aq)
* Pipette 25.0 $$cm^3$$ of $$H_2O_2$$â€‹ into a conical flask, add in a test tube full of $$H_2SO_4$$â€‹ and titrate it with $$KMnO_4$$ (aq)
* Titrate until one drop of $$KMnO_4$$ caused the solution to produce a permanent pink colourâ€‹
* Record the initial and final burette readings and calculate the volume of $$KMnO_4$$â€‹(aq) required in cm$$^3$$â€‹
* Repeat the titration until consistent results is achieved
* Calculate the concentration of potassium magnate (VII) using the formula: Conc of $$KMnO_4$$â€‹= (2 x known conc of $$H_2O_2$$â€‹x 25) / (5 x volume of $$KMnO_4$$ used in step 4)

## Metals (obtain a pure sample of carbon)

* Add an excess of dilute sulfuric aid to the mixture in a beaker
* Stir using a glass rod/ heat the mixture over a bunsen burner until no more solid can dissolve
* Filter the resulting mixture using a filter funnel with filter paper and conical flask
* The residue is a black solid (carbon) and the filtrate is a green solution (iron (II) sultate)
* Wash the black solid (carbon) using deionized/ distilled water
* Dry the black solid (carbon) between sheets of filter paper

## Acids (Purity of a sample)\\

* Weigh 1g of the mixture using an electronic balance
* Add excess warm sulfuric acid to the mixture and stir
* Filter the mixture, wash the carbon residue and dry it
* Reweigh the mixture and calculate the percentage by using the formula $$\frac{1g -mass}{1g} \times 100%$$

## Energy changes

* Measure 30$$cm^3$$ of distilled water and place it in a styrofoam cup nested on a beaker
* Measure the initial temperature of the water
* Weigh out 5g of salt X with an electronic balance
* Add the 5g of salt X to the water and measure the lowest temperature reached
* Repeat the mixture with salt Y and salt Z
* Find the temperature drop by taking the difference between the final and initial temperature
* The salt which gave the largest drop in temperature is the one which produces the greatest endothermic change when dissolved in water

## Metals (empirical formula)

* Weight the 20cm iron oxide using the electronic balance and record it as the initial mass
* Place the oxide in a crucible
* Strongly heat the oxide for 2 mins
* Weigh the oxide and record its mass
* Continue to heat the oxide and wight it until its mass becomes constant
* Record its final mass, which is the mass of iron
* The mass gain indicates the mas of oxygen gained to form the oxide
* Find the empirical formula of the iron oxide by finding the simplest mole ratio of the iron and oxygen
