# KQ2: What landforms and associated tectonic phenomena are found at plate boundaries?

## Fold mountains

* Fold mountains are formed along convergent plate boundaries, where plates move towards each other and collide
* The compressional force creates immense pressure, causing layers to buckle and fold, in an process known as folding
* The upfold is called the anticline while the downfold is known as the syncline
* When there is increasing compressional force on one limb of a fold, the rocks may buckle until a fracture forms, and the limb may then move to ride over the other limb
* Mostly found at convergent plate boundaries
* The Himalayas are formed when the continental Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate, and also leading to the elevation of the tibetan plateau
* The Rocky mountains are formed when the Juan de Fuca Plate collided with the North American Plate, and the Juan de Fuca plate almost completely subducted beneath the North American plate

## Rift valleys and block mountains

* Rift valleys and block mountains are formed at divergent plate boundaries, where plates are pulled apart
* Faults, which are fractures in the crust, may form due to tensional forces during faulting
* Along these fault, section of the crust can extend
* A rift valley is a valley with steep sides
* When sections of the crust extend along fault lines, tensional forces can cause a block of land to subside between a pair of parallel faults, forming a rift valley
* When the tensional forces cause the land masses surrounding a block of land to subside,a block mountain is formed along a pair of parallel faults
* A block mountain is a block of land with steep slopes left standing higher than the surrounding land
* Found at divergent plate boundaries
* The East African Rift Valley is formed due to the continental African Plate (Nubian) diverging with the continental African Plate (Somalian),

## Volcanoes

* A volcano is a landform formed by magma ejected from the mantle onto the earths surface
* Mostly found around the Pacific ring of fire, a margin of several converging plate boundaries around the pacific ocean
* A large number or earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur around the edges of the pacific ocean
* Active volcanoes are volcanoes which are currently erupting or expected to erupt in the near future
* Dormant volcanoes are currently inactive, but may erupt in the future
* Extinct volcanoes refer to volcanes without current seismic activity and no geological evidence of eruptions for the past thousands of years

1. Magma from the magma chamber rises to the surface through the vent, and ejected on the earth's surface as lava
2. Lava builds up around the vent, solidifying to form a small volcanic cone, and the bowl shaped opening is called the crater
3. When a volcano erupts, lava, ash and rock fragments are released, and the force of the eruption depends on the amount of pressure and gas in ammonia
4. The summit of a volcano may be blown off during an explosive eruption, and the sides of the crater collapse inwards due to the loss of structural support, and a large depression known as a caldera is formed
5. New eruption of lava covers the ash layer and builds up the volcano
6. During the formation of the volcano, the vent may become blocked, forcing the magma to find a new exit route to the surface, forming a secondary cone of newer volcanic material

* Volcanoes vary in shapes and sizes due to the characteristics of lava
* High silica lava is more viscous thus it flows slowly, and traps gas more easily, resulting in a build up of pressure below the earth's surface
* As the magma rises towards the earth's surface, the gases are able to expand,  causing an outward explosion, and the eruption ejects lava, ash, rock fragments and gases into the surrounding environment
* Low silica lava has a lower viscosity this is flows more easily over greater distances, and the gases can escape easily, and flows more easily though the vent before reaching the surface
* The outer layer of the lava forms a thin crust when cooled on the earth's surface

### Shield volcanos

* Shield volcanoes have gently sloping sides and a broad summit, and a broad base
* It has low silica lava, which flows easily and spreads out over a large area before solidifying
* The lava does not trap much gas and eruptions are not explosive
* With successive eruptions, the base of the volcano increases in size as lava accumulates
* Common near divergent plate boundaries where magma can directly rise directly from the mantle
* Mount Washington, USA

### Stratovolcanoes

* Stratovolcanoes develop form successive eruptions of lava and pyroclasts
* Pyroclasts refer to ash, rock fragments and volcanic bombs ejected during a volcanic eruption
* After an initial eruption of pyroclasts, the subsequent eruptions eject lava which covers the pyroclasts and prevents it from being eroded away
* Over time, successive eruptions build a high volcano with a slightly concave profile, and the volcanoes steeper at the top and gentler at the base
* Secondary cones may also develop as magma from the vent seeps into the side of the cone and erupt
* Commonly found near convergent plate boundaries
* Mount Pinatubo, Philippines
* Pyroclastic flow occurs when pyroclasts mix with super-heated gases ejected during a volcanic eruption, and it can reach speeds of up to 200 m/s
* Pyroclasts may also mix with water from melted ice or lakes to give rise to lahars, which are fast flowing mudflows reaching speeds of 40 m/s

## Earthquakes

* An earthquake is a vibration in the earth's crust caused by the sudden release of stored energy in the rocks along fault lines
* Due to friction between moving plates, plate movements cause the slow-build up of stress on the rocks of either side of the fault
* When the rocks can no longer stand the increasing stress, they can suddenly slip many metres, causing an earthquake
* It releases energy in the form of seismic waves
* Seismic waves radiate from a point of sudden energy release, called the focus
* The point directly directly above the focus on the earth's surface is called the epicentre
* Most of the energy releases from an earthquake travels along the surface of the earth, causing the ground to vibrate violently
* After an earthquake, the stress of the ground within the earth's crust may cause many smaller earthquakes called aftershocks to occur along the faultline, and can occur for several months after the earthquake, and be just as powerful as the original earthquake
* Deep-focus earthquake occur between 70-700 km below the earth's surface, and have a smaller impact on the land as the seismic waves take a longer time to reach the surface and would have lost their energy by them
* Shallow-focus earthquakes occur in the upper 70 km of the earth's surface and have a greater impact on the land as the seismic waves reach the land more quickly
* Mostly found around the pacific ring of fire
* Measured using the Richter scale, and every magnitude is ten times greater than the last one
* Seismographs are used to record the seismic waves

### Extent

#### Population density

* The number of people living in the affected area is an important factor
* Earthquakes in sparsely populated areas are likely to affect fewer people than in densely populated areas
* An earthquake in a city can cause more casualties and damage than an earthquake in the country sides as densely populated areas have a greater concentration of people and buildings

#### Level of preparedness

* The amount of preparation taken by the authorities and citizens make a significant difference to the impact of an earthquake
* These preparations include evacuation plans, trained rescue workers and a range of action plans
* The damaged caused by an earthquake is more manageable when people are better prepared for it

#### Distance from the epicentre

* The damage caused by an earthquake is more severe when the area is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake
* The closer the distance from the epicentre, the stronger the shockwaves received
* During the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, 2011, the epicentre was a town a few kilometers away from the city centre, causing the icty to suffer more damage than areas further away from the city

#### Time of occurence

* The time of day when an earthquake occurs determines where people are and what they are doing, affecting their chances of survival
* If the earthquake happens when most people are sleeping, there is a higher chance that these people will be trapped in their houses and more deaths may occur
* More than 2,400 people died when an earthquake occured a couple of hours after mindingth in the Sun Moon Lake Region in Taiwan in 1999

#### Type of Soil

* In places where the sediments are loose and unconsolidated, the seismic waves are amplified, resulting in greater damage when earthquakes occur
* Structures built on unconsolidated sediments can be affected by liquefaction, when the ground becomes unstable and saturated soil flows like a liquid
* In Christchurch, New Zealand, may houses and buildings had to be abandoned because of liquefaction after the earthquake in 2011

## Risks associated with living in earthquake zones

### Tsunamis

* Tsunamis are unusually large sea waves&#x20;
* Formed by the movement of the seafloor during a large earthquake at the subduction zones, and explosive underwater volcanic eruption, or a landslide caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions above sea level causing materials to plunge into the seawater

1. Seismic activities from an offshore earthquake forces out a mass of seawater
2. The tsunami waves may start at a height of less than 1m, with wavelengths of 100-150km, and speeds of 800km/h and may pass undetected
3. On reaching shallower water, greater friction slows the waves and forces them to increase in height
4. At the point of impact on the coast, the tsunami waves could be travelling at 30-50km/h, and may reach around heights of 15m
5. Sometimes, the seaweeds from the coast before advancing onshore, minutes before the tsunami reaches the shore. This is because water rushes to fill the void caused by movement of the seafloor, and forced out again afterwards, resulting in a tsunami

* Tsunamis can travel long distances and cause widespread destruction at coastal areas when it sweeps inland
* In 2004, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake occured in the Indian Ocean, triggering a tsunami with waves that spread throughout the INdian ocean, causing damage to coastal communities in 12 countries
* The most damage was experienced in the low-lying coastal areas of western Sumatra, Indonesia, including the city of Banda Aceh, where the waves were 4-39 m high, adn went as far inland as 10km, sweeping houses inland or out to sea

### Disruption of services

* An earthquake can disrupt services such as the supply of electricity, gas and water and potentially affect a large area
* Vibrations on the ground can snap pipes and break cables which may cause the outbreak of fires
* Communication services such as television broadcasts and telephone connections may also be affected
* The earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995 damaged pipes and transmission lines, disrupting electricity, gas and water supplies to about a million residents

### Landslides

* The shaking of the ground during earthquakes weakens the slopes of hills and mountains
* The unstable slopes may results in landslides, which are rapid downslope movements of soil, rock and vegetation debris from a slope
* Range from several meters to several kilometers in width and length
* Mudflows may also ocurre when heavy rainfall saturates the soil, causing the mixed soil debris to flow down the slope
* in 1970, an earthquake caused the coast of Peru destabilized the slopes of Mount Huascaran and triggered a massive landslide that travelled at more than 160 km/h, completely flattening the town of Ranrahirca within seconds, killing 18,000 and only leaving 200 alive

### Destruction of properties

* Earthquakes can also cause widespread destruction to many home. leaving people without homes and forcing them to reside at temporary shelters while their homes are being rebuilt
* The earthquake in Tohoku, Japan, in 2011 caused a tsunami that travelled up to 10km inland, resulting in extensive structural damage, forcing hundreds of thousand of people out from their homes
* There was a severe shortage of housing and concerns about the long-term consequences of the health of the people

### Destruction of infrastructure

* Earthquakes may cause cracks to form in infrastructure such as roads and bridges
* Transportation can be disrupted as it is unsafe to sue the damaged roads
* The earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995 made many places in the city becoming inaccessible or difficult to reach, and amounted to a total repair cos ot US$300 billion

### Loss of lives

* Earthquake and their associated hazards threaten the lives of those living in earthquake zones
* The earthquake in Tohoku, Japan, 2011, killed 28,000 people

## Risks of living near volcanic areas

### Massive destruction by volcanic materials

* Lava has high temperatures between 500-1,400°C, burning the areas it flows through
* Low-silica lava moves rapidly and flows over long distance, causing damage to larger areas
* A pyroclastic flow can destroy everything in its path with hot rock fragments ranging from ashato boulders travelling at speeds more than 200m/s
* Inhaling the hot ash and gases can result in serious injury or death
* Volcanic bombs of heated rocks can fall in areas surrounding the volcano and damage property, and they can be from several centimeters to the size of cars
* Landslides can occur due to the structural collapse of a volcanic cone during an volcanic eruption
* It can range from a few rock fragments to several hundreds of cubic metres falling from the volcano
* They have the potential to obstruct the flow of rivers causing floods, blocked roads and buried villages and farmlands
* The eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in the Andes mountains of South America in 1985 released a pyroclastic flow, which mixed with glacial ice along its path, triggering lahars
* The lahars engulfed the towns of town of Amero and killed more than 20,000 people

### Pollution

* Ash particles ejected during a volcanic eruption can disrupt human activities over large distances form the volcano
* This plumes of ash may settle on the ground and block sunlight, suffocate crops and cause severe respiratory problems for people and animals
* Volcanic eruptions also release gases such ar carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen and carbon monoxide which can be harmful to people
* Fine ash particles of less than 0.001mm can be carried by wind over thousands of kilometers and impact areas further away from the eruption source
* The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland in 2010 produced extensive volcanic ash clouds containing particles of abrasive glass, sand and rock
* These particles pose serious danger to aircraft engines and structures, resulting in the close of airspace over much of Europe
* Connecting flight worldwide were cancelled, causing delays to 1.2 million passengers dail and costing the airline industry a total of US$1.8 billion

## Benefits of living near volcanic areas

### Fertile soil

* Lava and ash from volcanic eruptions break down to form fertile volcanic soils
* They are the riches soils on earth and are very favourable to agriculture
* Although volcanic rocks are rich in materials, the minerals are not available to plants when the rocks are newly formed, and only available after they have been weathered and broken down for thousands of years
* The volcanic soils of Java and Bali in Indonesia support the cultivation of crops such as tea, coffee and rice
* It is the reason why these two islands have been able to support a large rural population over many decades
* They are more fertile than non-volcanic areas of Indonesia despite continuous uses

### Precious stones and materials

* Volcanic rocks can be rich in precious stones and minerals, which can only be extracted form volcanic areas after millions of years
* When the upper layers of volcanic rocks are eroded, the precious stones and minerals can be extracted
* Diamonds are heated and pressurized carbon that are cooled in magma pipes beneath the earth's surface
* When refined, diamonds are useful as industrial tools and in scientific research and used to make jewelry
* The old rocks at Kimberly in South Africa are one of the world's richest sources of diamonds

### Tourism

* Volcanic areas offer a variety of activities for tourists to engage in, such has hiking or camping in the area to to simply enjoy the scenery
* Volcanic areas are rich in history and people can visit these areas to learn more about them
* Pompeii, Italy was buried by layers of ash from the nearby Mount Vesuvius when in erupted in 79 CE
* The unearthed archeological site has revealed buildings, pottery and mosaics left intact, causing 3 million people to visit the site every year

### Geothermal energy

* Geothermal energy is derived from the heat in the earth's crust
* When groundwater comes into contact with hot rocks beneath the surface, it heats up and erupts as hot water or steam, which is harnessed to drive turbines and produce electricity
* Most of island electricity is generated from geothermal power because of the large number of volcanoes in the country
* 70% of home are heated by volcanic steam
