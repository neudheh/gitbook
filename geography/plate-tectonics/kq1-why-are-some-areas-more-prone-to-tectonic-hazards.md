# KQ1: Why are some areas more prone to tectonic hazards?

## Natural hazards

* A natural hazard is a naturally occurring event that threatens human lives and causes damage to property
* Can be tectonic (caused by plate movements when continental crusts and ocean floors move) or Climate-related (caused be severe and extreme weather and climate conditions)
* Tectonic hazards include earthquakes and volcanic eruptions while climate-related hazards include floods and storms

## Structure of the earth

### Core

* 3,500km thick, Temperatures of 3,000-5,000°C, Mostly iron and nickel
* Divided into inner and outer
  * Inner core is 1,400km thick, and mostly solid because of the extreme pressure exerted by other layers
  * Outer core is 2,100km thick, and it is liquid

### Mantle

* Mantle is 2,900km thick, Temperatures from 800-3,000°C, made out of solid rock that flows under high temperature and pressure
* Outer mantle, along with the crust, is known as the lithosphere, and it is rigid and brittle, floating on the softer asthenosphere
* The softer asthenosphere or 'weak sphere' is where high temperatures and pressure bring the rocks close enough to their melting point for them to be easily deformed

### Crust

* Made up of basalt and granite rocks, and is a few km to 70km thick

## Tectonic plates

* The crust is broken up into tectonic plates that move in relation to one another
* They are part of the lithosphere
* Made up of oceanic crust or continental crust

| Oceanic                                                                          | Continental                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Beneath deep oceans                                                              | Beneath the earth's continental land masses and under shallow seas close to continents |
| 5-8km thick                                                                      | 35-70km thick                                                                          |
| Mainly basalt, a heavy and dense rock formed from magma which has cooled quickly | Lighter rock, including granite                                                        |
| <200 million years old                                                           | A wide range of rock ages, form very recent - 4 billion years old                      |

### Movement

1. Convectional currents are movements of heat within the mantle, and are formed when material in the mantle is heated, expands and rises, spreading out beneath the plates
2. This causes the plates to be dragged along and move away from one another
3. The hot mantle material cools slightly and sinks, pulling the plates along
4. The sinking mantle material heats up again and the whole process repeats
5. Slab-pull force is when the dense, sinking oceanic plate at the subduction zone pulls the rest of the plate behind it, and it is thought to be the main driving mechanism for plate movement
6. The subducting or sinking plate drives the downward moving portion of convectional currents
7. The mantle material found away from where the plates subduct drives the rising portion of convection currents

## Divergent plate boundaries

### Oceanic-Oceanic

* When two oceanic plates diverge, fractures are formed at the plate boundary due to tensional forces
* Magma rises from the mantle to form new seafloor, known as a mid-oceanic ridge, in a process called seafloor spreading
* The mid-oceanic ridge is a central ridge structure that divides the ocean basin in half
* The newly formed rocks are closest to the mid-oceanic ridge, and are younger than those further away
* At various points along the mid-oceanic ridge, magma builds up and solidifies to form undersea volcanoes, and when these volcanoes grow above sea level, they are known as volcanic islands
* For example, the Mid-Atlantic ridge in the middle of the atlantic ocean, is formed when the oceanic north-american plate diverged from the oceanic european plate

### Continental-Continental

* When two continental plates diverges, they are stretched, and tensional forces cause fractures to form on the continental crust at the plate boundary
* The land in between the two plates sink, forming a linear depression known as a rift valley
* It is linear/ elongated, has a flat floor, and flanked by 2 steep sides
* For example, the East African River Valleys system was formed when the continental African plate (Nubian) diverged with the continental African plate (Somalian)
* It consists of a series of rift valleys 20-60 km long, and has active volcanoes and earthquake fractures

## Convergent plate boundaries

### Oceanic-Oceanic

* When two oceanic plates converge, the denser plate subducts under the less dense plate
* The area at which this happens is known as the subduction zone
* At the subduction zone, a deep oceanic trench, which is a depression in the sea floor, is created
* The subducted oceanic plate causes the mantle material above it to melt, forming magma
* The magma rises through the crust and forms volcanoes, and eventually, a chain or arc of islands is formed
* Earthquakes may also occur at the boundary between two plates due to the friction between the moving rock masses when a plate subducts beneath another
* For example, the oceanic pacific plate converged with the oceanic philippine plate, and the denser pacific plate subducted, forming the mariana trench and the mariana islands

### Continental-Continental

* When two continental plates converge, both plates resist subduction as they are both too thick and buoyant for subduction to occur
* The compressional forces causes the layers to buckle and fold upwards or sideways, creating fold mountains
* For example, the continental indian plate converged with the continental eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas

### Oceanic-Continental

* When an oceanic plate converges with a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate subducts beneath the less dense continental plate
* A deep oceanic trench is formed at the subduction zone
* The compressional forces causes the continental plate to buckle and fold upwards or sideways, creating fold mountains
* At the subduction zone, the subducted oceanic plate causes the mantle material above it to melt forming magma
* The magma rises through the crust, giving rise to volcanoes and volcanic eruptions
* For example, when the oceanic australian plate converged with the continental eurasian plate near Sumatra, formed the Sunda trench and the Barisan mountains

## Transform plate boundaries

* Plates slide past each other in transform plate boundaries, resulting in the formation of a transform fault
* Tremendous stress builds up and is eventually released often in the form of violent earthquakes
* For example, when the Anatolian plate slid past the eurasian plate, it formed the north anatolian fault
* For the past 70 years, a major earthquake has occurred every 10 years on average on the north anatolian fault
* A major earthquake in Turkey in 1999 largely destroyed the town of Izmit
* Since the 1990s, each successive earthquake has occurred further west along the boundary, putting the city of Istanbul and its population of more than 10 million people in considerable danger
