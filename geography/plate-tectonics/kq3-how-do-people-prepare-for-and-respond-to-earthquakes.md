# KQ3: How do people prepare for and respond to earthquakes?

## Preparedness measures

### Land use regulation

* Land use regulations are a set of rules implemented to restrict developments in certain areas
* In California USA, all buildings are not built across fault areas or areas at risk of liquefaction
* Liquefaction occurs when vibrations from an earthquake cause saturated soil to flow like a liquid, and the ground becomes unstable and buildings should not be constructed in these areas as it is unsafe
* They also can prohibit constructing new buildings on low-lying land which are vulnerable to tsunamis, only allowing development when protective barriers such as seawalls facing the ocean are built
* Commonly implemented along the coasts of Japan and North America, which is around the pacific ring of fire
* They may need to be carried out in areas that are already built-up or privately owned, and governments would buy land from private owners, compensate those that have to move and put into place effective protective measures
* This can be costly, and private owners may be reluctant to move because they believe that another hazard would not happen

### Infrastructure

* Infrastructure needs to be developed with advance engineering to withstand the vibrations associated with the earthquake
* Effective building design can reduce the collapse of buildings and minimise the damage caused by an earthquake
* Roads, bridges and dams can be built to resist tha shaking of the ground so that they do not collapse, or can be easily repaired if they collapse
* Homes, office buildings and factories can be fitted with trip switches to ensure all electrical points are switched off in the event of an earthquake, preventing fires from breaking out
* Taipei 101 in Taiwan is built with a steel ball mass dampener, which acts as a shock absorber for the seismic energy released during and earthquake and act as a counterweight which move in the direction opposite to the earthquake
* As a result, the Taipei 101 has successfully withstood multiple earthquakes and typhoons which has shaken the region despite its size
* However, it adds to the cost of constructing and maintaining buildings, and buildings are only designed based on the most serious earthquake ever experienced in the area in the past

### Emergency drills

* Emergency drills are where people practise the steps to take when an earthquake occurs, creating awareness among the population and reducing the levels of panic and irrational behaviour during an earthquake
* Thy move to safe locations, listen to instructions given by trained personnel and practise first aid, and may also become members of the local response team that assist people during a disaster
* Every year since 1960, Japan conducts emergency drills on 1 September, Disaster Prevention Day
* People all over Japan are involved, and an earthquake of high magnitude is simulated to prepare the people mentally on how to react to a disaster
* Main roads are blocked to create the possible road conditions in the event of an earthquake, and emergency vehicles have to find alternative routes to reach affected areas
* However, emergency drills are designed based on the most serious earthquake ever recorded in the ara in a past, and are only effective if there is enough time for people to evacuate
* The earthquake in Tohoku, Japan, 2011 was on a scale never recorded before in Japan, causing the emergency drills and evacuation plans to be inadequate

### Earthquake monitoring and warning systems

* Earthquakes can be monitored by studying the history of where and when they occured, providing an estimation of the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes at particular faults
* Installing earthquake sensors in earthquake-prone zones helps monitor the frequency of vibrations and detect possible developments of an earthquake
* Earthquake motion data is gathered from hundreds of observation stations installed on bridges and roads in Japan, which monitor ground motion, and allow the occurrence of earthquakes to predicted
* Earthquake sensors also are used to quickly estimate the damage to bridges railways and other infrastructure
* However
  * They are expensive to install and use
  * An earthquake occurs seconds after a warning is sounded, providing insufficient time for evacuation
  * Noise, lighting or device failure may interfere with the seismograph, giving false warnings
  * It is difficult to give accurate warnings when earthquake occur close to each other

### Tsunami monitoring and warning systems

* Tsunami monitoring devices help predict tsunamis, and are often linked to warning system, which are activated to warn people about the occurrence of a tsunami
* A surface buoy is connected to a pressure sensor anchored to the seafloor
* Temperature and pressure are measured and relayed to the buoy every 15s
* Information is sent via satellite for land-based tsunami warning stations for analysis
* A network of pressure sensors, seismographs and deep ocean tsunami detectors are located in Hawaii, USA to monitor and forecast the path of tsunamis
* But they are prone to giving false alarms when waves are high, and there is little time to evacuate once an approaching tsunami is detected

## Short term responses

### Search and rescue

* People trapped under collapse buildings are quickly located and freed
* Some survivors are found after being trapped for a couple weeks without food
* After the earthquake in Tohoku, Japan, 2011, sniffer dogs and heat sensors were deployed and successfully rescued many who were trapped
* Rescue workers only have a limited time of 72 hours, or 3 days to find survivors, as without food and water, trapped survivors are unlikely to survive after 3 days
* Rescue workers had a limited time of 3 days to rapidly search through 2 towns after the earthquake in Tohoku, Japan in 2011

### Emergency, food and medical supplies

* The injured are treated and clean drinking water is provided to survivors and the spread of diseases
* The provision of immediate aid helps survivors continue with their lives
* After the earthquake in Afyon in 2002, the Turking Red Crescent Society immediately responded by delivering 20,000 tents, 50,000 blankets and 3,000 heaters to the region
* Medical supplies, food and water may not be enough and this can cause social unrest
* After the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, looting and fighting broke out as people fought for food and medical supplies

## Long term responses

### Rebuilding of infrastructure

* Infrastructure and amenities are rebuilt and improved upon after a disaster
* Authorities often develop stricter building codes to ensure that infrastructure is restored at a higher safety level than before
* After the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, in 1995, Japan spent billions developing technology to build more earthquake-resistant buildings
* Reinforced buildings, which are built to protect against earthquakes, are not necessarily protected against tsunamis
* Additional protection could be in the form of coastal protection structures such as breakwaters
* Although many of Chile's buildings are earthquake-resistant, the coastal areas suffered massive damage form a tsunami when an earthquake struck in 2010

### Provision of healthcare

* Health options such as long-term counselling are provided as the loss of loved ones, homes or jobs after earthquakes can cause long-lasting trauma
* Problems can be identified and addressed early
* A year after the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2011, significant problems of anxiety and depression were identified amongst all age groups of the affected population
* A greater of health workers were then deployed in the area
* Improving health options, such as restoring the resilience of people after an earthquake, can be very challenging
* Many survivors such as those in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, continue to lack access to basic necessities
