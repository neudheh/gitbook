# KQ1: How and why are coastal environments different and dynamic?

## What is a coastal environment

* The coast is the area where the land meets the sea
* It covers the area of land that is affected by waves and tides
* Result of interactions between the land, water and living things
* The characteristics of coasts, as well as the diverse landforms found result form many factors and processes interacting with one another
* Changes occur constantly in coastal environments and make these environments dynamic

## Factors affecting coastal envrioments

### Waves

* Occurs when wind blows across the surface of seas and oceans
* Energy from the wind is transferred tot he water and this helped shapes coasts when the waves hit land

### Tides

* Tides refer to the daily alternate rise and fall in sea level caused mainly by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on earth
* Produces a cycle of alternating low and high tides which changes every 6 hours
* At high tides, waves erode and transport more sediments away from larger parts of the coast than at other times

### Currents

* Currents are large-scale, continuous movements of water in seas and oceans
* They are driven largely by prevailing winds which generally blow in one direction
* Help to distribute sediments and regulate temperatures

### Geology

* Geology is the arrangement of rock found in the area
* Harder rocks will erode more slowly than softer rocks

### Types of ecosystems

* In an ecosystem, communities of plants and animals interact with each other as well as the environment
* Affect the rate of change of coastal environments by reducing the impacts of waves on coasts

### Human activities

* People change coastal envrioments by living, trading, fishing and engaging in recreational activities
* They can also cause pollution by dumping waste

## What are waves and how are they generated?

* The crest is the highest part of a wave, while the trough is the lowest part of a wave
* Wave length is the horizontal distance from crest to crest or through to trough
* Wave frequency is the number of wave crests or troughs that pass a fixed point in one second
* Wave height is the vertical distance between crests and trough
* Water particles move in an orbit, and this motion decreases with depth

### Factors affecting wave energy

* Wave speed - The faster the wind blows, the greater the wave energy
* Wind duration - The longer thew wind blows, the larger the waves are, resulting in greater wave energy
* Fetch (Distance the wind has traveled over seas and oceans to form waves) - The greater the fetch, the more energy the waves have

### Waves in the open ocean vs close to the coastline

* Waves in the open ocean have a long wavelength and a low wave height
* Water particles in the ocean move in an orbit, a motion decreases with depth
* As waves approach the coastline, the water is shallow and the waves interact with the seabed, and change their shape to a depth of 1/2 their wavelength
  * As the waves continue to move in the shallow water, the base of the wave starts to slow down due to friction, causing wave height to increase and wave length to decrease
  * The base of the wave stops but the wave crest becomes steeper and topples over, causing the wave to break onto the coast, and releasing the energy of the wave

## How do waves affect coastal areas?

* When waves break, the waters run up the beach in what is called a swash, and brings sediments with it
* Swash loses energy due to gravity and friction with the land and returns to the sea as backwash, and it carries sediments form the shore into the sea

### Constructive vs destructive waves

| Constructive waves                                | Destructive waves                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Break far from the shore                          | Break violently on the shore                |
| Low gradient, low energy environment              | Steep gradient, high energy environment     |
| Small, low waves                                  | Large, high waves                           |
| Low wave height                                   | High wave height                            |
| Long wave length                                  | Short wave length                           |
| Wave frequency of 6-8 per minute                  | Wave frequency of 10-14 per minute          |
| Swash more powerful than backwash                 | Backwash more powerful than swash           |
| Occur on gentle coastal slope and sheltered coast | Occur on steep coastal slope and open coast |
| Deposition process more prominent                 | Erosion process more prominent              |

### Wave refraction

* Wave refraction is the process by which waves change direction as they approach a coast
* This occurs as waves slow down due to interactions with the sea bed as they move towards the coast
* Waves tend to converge or bend towards headlands as they tend to encounter friction with the headland as they approach the coast, causing them to slow down and break onto it
* This causes the wave height tin increase and the erosive energy to increase
* Waves diverge or bend away when approaching bays as parts of the wave that reach shallow water first slow down while the other parts of the waves continue at the same speed
* This results in reduce wave height as reduced erosive energy
* Headlands will retreat and beaches at bays would be built up, and eventually the coast would be straightened due to constant erosion and deposition

## Coastal processes

### Coastal erosion

* Coastal erosion takes place in 4 main ways
* Hydraulic action&#x20;
  * When waves strike against a rock surface, the waves trap air in the rock joints
  * The air is compressed by the oncoming waves, exerting pressure on the joints
  * As the air is repeatedly compressed, the joints weaken and the rocks shatter
* Abrasion
  * As waves break, sediments carried by waves such as sand and rocks are hurled against the coast
  * The loosened sediments knock and scrape against the coastal cliffs
  * This weakens the surface and breaks down the coast
  * Over time, the impact form abrasion is powerful enough to undercut a cliff
* Attrition
  * When rock particles carried by waves rub or hit against one another, they break down into smaller pieces and become smoother and more rounded over time
* Solution
  * Sea water reacts chemically with water-soluble minerals in coastal rocks
  * When solution of minerals occurs, rocks are weakened and eventually disintegrate

### Sediment transport

* Sediments are transported along coasts through two related processes: beach drift and longshore drift
* As waves approaching the coast at an angle break on the beach, sediments move up the beach at an angle as swash and move perpendicularly down the beach as backwash
* The resultant zigzag movement along the beach is known as beach drift
* When waves approach the coast at an angle according to the direction of the prevailing wind, they generate longshore currents in the nearshore zone and move sediments along the shore
* Longshore currents are ocean currents that flow parallel to the coast
* The combined effect of sediment movement by longshore currents and beach drift is known as longshore drift

### Sediment deposition

* Sediments eroded from the coast are transported away and deposited elsewhere
* When wave energy decreases, the waves are unable too carry these sediments
* Large sediments are deposited first followed by smaller sediments
* Deposited sediments vary in shape and size, resulting in a variety of beaches
* In areas where coasts are sheltered from strong winds, destructive waves are less common
* Fine sediments are deposited along sheltered coasts with calm waters
* In deep bays sheltered by headlands, sandy beaches are common
* Coarser sediments are likely to settle in more exposed bays where there is higher wave energy to remove the finer sediments

## Coastal landforms

### Cliffs and shore platforms

* A cliff refers to a steep and near vertical rock face found along coasts, and it is produced by the action of waves undercutting a steep, rocky coast

1. Hydraulic action and abrasion may erode a crack or joint on the rock surface, gradually enlarging the crack or joint to form a notch
2. This notch may be further depend to produce a bigger hollow space called a cave
3. Further erosion by the waves eventually causes the roof of the cave to collapse and form a steep cliff
4. As erosion continues, an overhanging cliff is formed, and eventually it will collapse and the materials will be deposited at  the foot of the cliff. Some of the materials may be carried by waves and thrown against the base of the cliff, causing further erosion
5. Over time, the cliff will retreat inland and a gently sloping platform appears at the base where the cliff used to be. This is called a shore platform, which is submerged during high tides

### Headlands and bays

* Some coastlines have alternate bands of more resistant and less resistant rock arranged at right angles to the coast
* The less resistant rocks will be eroded faster than the more resistant rocks
* When the less resistant rocks are eroded away, bays are formed, which are wide indented coasts
* The remaining more resistant rocks which extend into the sea are known as headlands

### Caves, arches and stacks

* Within headlands, some rocks may be less resistant to erosion than other rocks, and will be eroded more quickly by hydraulic action and abrasion
* Waves attack lines of weaknesses at the base of the headland and undercut it
* The continuous action of waves forms a cave at the area that is hollowed out by wave action
* Caves may develop on each side of the headland, and erosion may eventually join caves together, leaving a bridge of rock known as an arch above
* After a period of time, the roof of the arch may collapse to form a stack, a pillar of rock left in the sea after an arch collapses

### Beaches

* A beach is a zone of sediment deposition, formed form loose sand, gravel, pebbles, broken shells and corals or a mixture of them
* Beach mateirals may come from eroded cliffs, river deposits and sediments carried by waves
* The composition of material depends on the source of materials, and the size of mateirals may change over time due to changes in wave energy or the source of materials
* Finer grain sizes tend to result in beaches with a gentler gradient while materials of coarser grains form beaches with a steeper gradient
* Beaches are constantly changing as thier shapes are affected by waves, tides and currents
* During calm weather, constructive waves can help deposit mateirals on the beach and build it up further
* During coastal storms, Strong waves will erode and remove amteirals form the beach
* When waves break, the stronger swash moves up the beach, carrying and depositing the materials
* The bigger and coarser sediments, being heavier are left inland as the backwash is weaker and cannot bring them back to sea
* The lighter and finer ones are carried by backwash are are deposited nearer

### Spits and tombolos

* A spit is a long narrow ridge of sediments with one end attached to the land, formed by longshore drift
* It has one end connected to a mainland and the other projecting out into the sea
* When there is an abrupt end in the coastline, longshore drift may continue to transport materials in the original direction for some distance
* The materials are deposited in the sea after the bend where they accumulate over time
* This formes a ridge or sediments from the point where the coast line changes firection
* A hook or a curve may develop at one end of the spit, most likely due to wave refeaction consentrating at that point
* If an offshore island lies near the mainland where the spit is forming, the spit may continue to extend untill it connects the offhsore island to a mainland
* The new landform is called a tombolo
