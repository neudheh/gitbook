# KQ1: How and why are coastal environments different and dynamic?

## What is a coastal environment?

* The coast is the are by which the Land meets the sea
* It is an area of land that is affected by waves and tides
* Can be divided into the offshore, the nearshore, the foreshore, and the backshore
* The coastal environment is the result of interactions between the land, water and living things

### How are they different?

* They can be cliffed, sandy, muddy, rocky
* They are affected by the following factors

#### Waves

* Waves are generated when the energy from wind blowing across seas and oceans is transferred to the water surface
* Main force that shapes the coastline and features
* The stronger the waves, the faster the erosion

#### Tides

* Tides are the daily alternate rise and fall in sea level caused by the moon's gravitational pull
* At high tides, there is greater coastal erosion, sediment transportation and deposition as they can reach places not usually affected at other times

#### Currents

* Currents are large-scale, continuous movements of water in seas and oceans in certain directions driven largely by prevailing winds (winds that are blowing in the same direction most times of the year)

#### Geology

* Geology is the arrangement, structure and composition of rocks in the area
* The composition is the hardness of rocks and their rate of erosion, affecting the rate of change along costs
* The structure is the number of joints in the rocks. The more joints, the more easily the rock is eroded
* Arrangement - Different types of rock arranged together would result in a coast with different coastlines

#### Types of ecosystems

* In an ecosystem, communities of plants and animals interact with each other as well as the environment
* For example, coral reefs and mangroves reduce the rate or erosion (Covered later in [kq2-why-are-coastal-areas-valuable.md](kq2-why-are-coastal-areas-valuable.md "mention"))

## Waves

* Waves develop when energy from the wind blowing across seas and oceans are transferred to the water surface
* The highest part of a wave is called the crest while the lowest part of the wave is the trough
* The wavelength is the horizontal distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough
* Wave height is the vertical distance from the crest to the trough
* Wave frequency is the number of wave crests or troughs that pass a fixed point in a second
* Wave particles move in an orbit, this motion decreases with depth
* Wave steepness the the ratio of wave height to wavelength
* Wave period is the time waves take to travel through one wavelength

### Factors affecting wave energy

* Wind speed - The faster the wind blows, the greater the wave energy is
* Wind duration - The longer the wind blows, the larger the waves are, the greater the wave energy
* Fetch (Distance the wind has travelled over seas and oceans to form waves) - The greater the fetch, the more energy the waves have

### Waves in the open ocean

* Waves in the open ocean have a long wavelength and a low wave height
* Water particles move in an orbit, a motion that rapidly decreases with depth

### Waves close to the coastline

* Near the coastline, the water is shallow and the waves interact with the sea bed
  * The waves start to change their shape at a depth that is equivalent to about half their wavelength
* Nearer to the coastline, as the waves continue to move in the shallow water, the base of the waves starts to slow down due to friction
  * This causes the wave height to increase, and the wave length to decrease
* Nearest to the coastline, the base of the wave stops, but the wave crest becomes steeper and topples over
  * This wave breaks onto the coast, and releases the energy of the wave
  * When the energy within  a wave is released on a cast, it breaks down rocks along the coastline into smaller particles
  * These particles are then moved away to other parts of the coast

### Swash and backwash

* When waves break, water rushes up the beach, and this is called a swash
* As the swash moves up the energy of the beach, it carries sediments with it
* Swash loses energy due to gravity and friction with the land, and returns to the sea as backwash
* The backwash carriers sediments form the shore into the sea

### Constructive VS destructive waves

* Constructive waves break far from the shore and with little energy
  * Finer material is deposited, which in turn forms gentle slopes
  * Have a strong swash, but a weak backwash
  * Landforms such as beaches are constructed by constructive waves as the strong swash deposits sediments on the coasts, while the weak backwash only removes some, and over time, the coasts are built up by the deposited sediments
* Destructive waves break violently on the shore with high energy
  * Finer material tends to be transported away, leaving only coarser material which in turn form steeper slopes
  * Weak swash but a strong backwash
  * Erode coasts and transport rocks and beach material away

| Constructive                                   | Destructive                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Low gradient, low energy environment           | Steep gradient, high energy environment      |
| Small, low waves                               | Large, high waves                            |
| Low wave height                                | High wave height                             |
| Long wave length                               | Short wave length                            |
| Wave frequency of 6-8 waves per minute         | Wave frequency of 10-14 waves per minute     |
| Swash more powerful than backwash              | Backwash more powerful than swash            |
| Occur on gentle coastal slope and gentle coast | Occur on steep coastal slopes and open coast |
| Deposition process more prominent              | Erosion process more prominent               |

### Wave refraction

* Wave refraction is the process by which waves change direction as they approach a coast
* This occurs as waves slow down due to interaction with the seabed as they move towards the coast
* Waves tend to converge or bend towards headlands, giving rise to increased wave height and greater erosive energy
  * This occurs because waves encounter friction with the headland as they approach the coast, causing them to slow down and break onto it
* When waves approach bays, the diverge or bend away, resulting in decreased wave height and reduced erosive energy
  * This occurs as parts of the wave that reach shallow water first slow down while the others continue at the same speed
* Headlands will retreat and beaches at bays would be built up, eventually the coastline would be straightened due to constant corrosion and deposition
* When waves approach a relatively straight coast at an angle, they are refracted and break almost parallel to the coast

## Coastal processes

### Coastal erosion

* Coastal erosion takes place inn 4 main ways
* Hydraulic action
  * When waves strike against a rock surface, waves trap air in the rock joints
  * The air is compressed by the oncoming waves, exerting pressure on the joints
  * As the air is repeatedly compressed, the joints weaken and the rocks shatter
* Abrasion
  * As waves break, sediments carried by waves such as sand and rocks are hurled against the coast
  * The loosened sediments knock and scrape against the coastal cliffs
  * This weakens the surface and breaks down the coast
  * Over time, the impact from abrasion is powerful enough to undercut a cliff
* Attrition
  * When rock particles carried by wave rub or hit against one another, they break down into smaller pieces and become smoother and more rounded over time
* Solution
  * Sea water reacts chemically with water-soluble minerals in coastal rocs and dissolve them
  * Example: Limestone rocks are easily eroded by carbonic acid
  * When solution of minerals occur, rocks are weakened and eventually disintegrate&#x20;

### Sediment transport

* Sediments are transported along the coasts through two related processes, beach drift and longshore drift
* They are the result of waves approaching the coast at an angle
* As waves approach the coast at an angle break on the beach, sediments move up the beach at an angle as swash and move perpendicularly down the beach as backwash, and the resultant movement is known as beach drift
* When waves approach the coast at an angle according to the prevailing wind direction, longshore currents in the nearshore zone are generated and move sediments along the shore
  * Longshore currents are currents that flow parallel to a coast
* The combined effect of sediment movement by longshore currents and beach drift is known as longshore drift

### Sediment deposition

* Sediments eroded from the coast are transported away and deposited elsewhere
* When wave energy decreases, the waves are unable to carry these sediments
* Large sediments are deposited first, followed by smaller sediments
* Deposited sediments vary in type and size, resulting in a variety of beaches
* The location of coasts influences the deposition of sediments
* In areas which are sheltered from strong winds, destructive waves are less common, the waters are calm, and fine sediments are deposited
* In deep bays surrounded by headlands, sandy beaches are common
* Coarser sediments are likely to settle in more exposed bays where there is higher wave energy to remove the finer sediments

## Coastal landforms

### Cliffs and shore platforms

* A cliff refers to a steep and near vertical rock face found along coasts
* It is produced by the action of waves undercutting a steep,rocky coast
* Hydraulic action and abrasion may erode a crack or a joint on the rock surface, gradually enlargening the crack or join to form a notch
* The notch may be further deepened to produce a bigger hollow space called a cave
* Further erosion by the waves eventually causes the roof of the cave to collapse and form a steep cliff
* As the process of erosion continues, an overhanging cliff is formed, and eventually this cliff will collapse and the materials will be collected at the foot d the cliff
  * Some of these materials may be carried by waves and thrown against the base of the cliff, causing further erosion
  * Over time, the cliff will retreat inland and a gently sloping platform appears at the cliff where the cliff used to be
  * This platform is called a shore platform, which is submerged during high tides

### Headlands and bays

* Some coastlines have alternate bands or more resistant and less resistant rocks arranged at right angles to the coast
* The less resistant rocks will be eroded faster than the more resistant rocks
* When the less resistant rocks are eroded away, bays are formed, which are wide indented coasts
* The remaining more resistant rocks which extend into the sea are known as headlands

### Caves, arches and stacks

* Within headlands, some rocks may be less resistant to erosion than other rocks
  * These parts of the headland will be eroded more quickly, especially by hydraulic action and abrasion
  * Waves attack lines of weakness (joints/ faults) at the base of the headland and undercut it
  * The continuous action of wave forms a cave at the area that is hollowed by wave action
* Caves may develop on either side of the headland
  * Erosion may eventually join caves together, leaving a bridge of rock known as an arch above the opening
* After a period of time, the roof of the arch may collapse to form a stack, which is a pillar of rock in the sea left behind after an arch collapses

### Beaches

* A beach is a zone of sediment deposition, usually formed from loose sand, gravel, pebbles, broken shells and corals, or a mixture of these materials
* Beach materials may come from eroded cliffs, river deposits and sediments carried by waves
* The composition/ type depends on what sediments exist in the coastal areas around the beach (i.e. hard or soft rocks, mineral content) -> Determines the different colours too
* Beaches are constantly changing as their shapes are affected daily by waves, tides and currents
  * Size of materials may change over time due to changes in wave energy (e.g. destructive waves at different times of the year may bring in coarser materials during storms) or the source of materials
  * The grain size affects the slope of the beach, and finer grain sizes result in beaches with a gentle gradient, while beaches with coarser grains form beaches with a steeper gradient
* When waves break, swash, being stronger moves up the beach, carrying and depositing the materials
* The bigger and coarser sediments, being heavier, are left inland as the backwash is weaker and cannot bring them back to sea
* Only the finer and lighter sediments are carried seawards by backwash, and deposited nearer to the water's edge

### Spits and tombolos

* A spit is a long, narrow ridge of sediments with one end attached to the land formed by longshore drift
* It has one end connected to the mainland and the other projecting out into the sea
* When there is an abrupt bend in the coastline, longshore drift may continue to transport materials in the original direction for some distance
* The materials are deposited in the sea after the bend where they accumulate over time along the original direction of the coastline
* This forms a ridge of sediments from the point where the coastline changes direction
* A hook or a curve may develop at one end of the spit, most likely due to wave refraction concentrating at that point
* If an offshore island lies near the mainland where the spit if forming, the spit may continue to extend until it connects the offshore island to the mainland
* This new landform is called a tombolo
