# KQ2: Why are coastal areas valuable?

## How do people use coastal areas

### Fisheries and aquaculture

* The worldwide demand for fish has grown so much that large areas of the world's oceans are overfished
* This has led to people rearing fish in fisheries
* Fisheries are areas where fish are bred and raised to meet the growing demand for fish
* 1/3 of the world's fish supply now comes from fisheries
* These include farming fish in cages or ponds close to coasts, in rivers or in converted wetlands, and this form of farming is known as aquaculture
* One example would be Ca Mau, Vietnam
  * In the 1980s, 60,000 hectares of coastal mangroves were cleared for building materials, firewood, charcoal and medicinal herbs, and converted into shrimp farms
  * These areas are favourable for shrimp productions as they are already waterlogged, and the remaining mangroves protect the area from storms and coastal flooding
  * Ponds are constructed from mud or concrete to hold water and shrimps
  * Production rapidly accelerated in the 1990s and the early years of the 21st century, reaching a record high of US$800 million in 2010
  * It is now the nation's shrimp production centre
  * However, Vietnam's coastline is nore more vulnerable to erosion from storms and pollution from pond waste

### Housing and transportation

* Many people live near the coast, but some live right on it
* Housing refers to shelter provided for people, is seen in the form of stilt houses, where houses are built on stilts above water and connected by walkways
* The walkways allow people to move within the community, and boats also facilitate movement, and are a common mode of transportation
* The coast is used for day-to-day activities, e.g. the daily tides remove household waste from the area
* One example would be Kukup, Malaysia
  * Kukup, a town in Malaysia, is 25km the west of Singapore, with stilt house communities
  * Air Masin is one village in Kukup with 180 stilt houses
  * Floating fish farms are also a common sight
  * Fresh fish and other marine products (Salted fish, dried prawns) are sold at these farms
  * There are 2 modes of transportation - Boats are used by local fishermen to facilitate their fishin activities, while frequent and schedules ferry services are used by visitors to go to Kukup Island, an island west of Kukup town
  * Kukup has become an attractive tourist destination, with its economy largely driven by the income earned from local and foreign tourists

### Tourism and recreation

* People usually associate coasts with tourism and recreation
* Tourism involves the temporary movement or people (tourists), primarily for leisure or recreational purposes
* Recreation involves activities done for enjoyment when one is not working
* Coasts are therefore popular for tourism or recreation&#x20;
* For example, Sentosa is one example of coastal area used for tourism and recreation
  * Located 500m south of the main island of Singapore
  * Occupied by a chain of sheltered artificial beaches on is southern coast, 2 golf courses, a marina, an exclusive residential area on its west and and an integrated resort, Resorts World Sentosa on the north of the island
  * Many recent developments in Sentosa have capitalised on the coast
  * ONE °15 Marina Club has world-class marina facilities
  * The Marina is in a harbour with wharfs offering maintenance services for boats and yachts, and it also has recreational boating facilities
  * Resorts World Sentosa has also maximised the use of its waterfront by building its hotel, museum and marine life part on the coast
  * Sentosa thus has 19 million visitors in 2011, a 600% increase from 2003
  * The increased numbers of tourists in turn fuelled further developments to meet demand, such as the upgrading of transport and parking facilities, enhancement of beaches, the creation of a massive lagoon, and the developments of more attractions such as a boardwalk connecting Sentosa to Singapore

## Coral reefs

* Coral reefs are structures that develop at or slightly below sea level on the seabed
* They are built and made out of thousands of tiny animals known as coral polyps, which secrete rock-like deposits of calcium carbonate to protect the soft and delicate body of the polyp
* Mostly found between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn
* Southeast Asia has the largest area and highest biodiversity of coral reefs in the work with about 70,000km²&#x20;
* Highest concentration of coral reefs are located in the Indo-Pacific region that include the coral triangle and the Great Barrier Reef

### Environmental conditions

* Only located at certain places because they are fragile environments
* Average seawater salinity of 34-37 parts per thousand
* A moderate amount of water movement ensures that corals receive sufficient levels of oxygen
* Sediments may suffocate living corals
* Sea surface temperature not lower than 17-18°C
* Clear saline water between 10-60m deep allows sufficient sunlight to penetrate, triggering algae photosynthesis
* The turbidity of the water, which refers to its level if murkiness, is low enough to allow sufficient sunlight to penetrate

### Value

* The value of coral reefs is their crucial role in supporting natural ecosystems, allowing a wide range of marine creatures to breed and grow, hence they are habitats
* They support 25% of the earth's marine fish species
* Marine creatures that live around reefs provide food for larger creatures
* Parrot fish graze on the living coral polyps, and larger fish and mammal's also pray on the smaller creatures
* Coral reefs absorb wave energy, protecting the adjacent land masses from erosion
* However, during severe storms, such as those generated by a tropical cyclone, coral reefs can be severely damaged, and recovery is slow, making coasts more prone to erosion

## Mangroves

* Mangrove species are salt-tolerant tropical or sub-tropical plants which grow in conditions that most plants are unable to
* They grow in tidal mud on sheltered coasts
* They are found on the coasts and river estuaries with muddy and waterlogged land, between the tropics of cancer and capricorn
* Concentrated around the Malay peninsula, Borneo and Northern Australia

### Environmental conditions

* They are a type of halophyte, which is a plant that grows naturally in a saline environments
* Found along sheltered coasts and river estuaries with muddy and waterlogged land
* Sheltered coasts experience low energy waves that allow sediments to accumulate, including mud and plant litter which provide nutrients for mangroves to thrive
* Mangroves have various characteristics which allow them to adapt to the saline environment
* Adaptation refers tot he ability of life forms to adjust to changing conditions
* Since many plants cannot adapt to the saline water and oxygen-deficient soil of a tidal environment, mangrove ecosystems have a few species of plants
* To cope with the waterlogged environment, some species of mangroves some species of mangroves such as the Avicennia and Sonneratia have aerial breathing roots that take in oxygen during parts of the day when they are not submerged
* Prop roots help to anchor the trees firmly in the soft muddy ground, ensuring thy will not be uprooted or swept away by the strong waves
* Kneed roots help to trap soil between their roots, which is essential for plant growth
* Some mangrove fruits are javelin-shaped so that they can perece the soft mud to germinate and grow into a sapling
* Some fruits are buoyant allowing them to float away and germinate in other coastal areas

### Value

* Mangroves can play a key role in stabilising shorelines
* Their dense network of roots can absorb the energy of waves, slowing the flow of water
* The network of roots allows sediments that are washed down by rivers and washed up on coasts to build amongst mangrove roots
* The dense network of mangrove roots and the build-up of sediments can help protect coastal areas from erosion by tides, storm waves and tsunamis
* They absorb the force of storms though their dense root system
* As storm waves approach the coast, their speed is reduced due to friction, hence reducing the impacts of storms on coasts
* A number of coastal sites in the Indian Ocean affected by the devastating 2004 tsunami have been replanted with mangroves to protect the coasts from future tsunamis
* It is also a breeding ground and habitat for a range of marine creatures, as barnacles, oysters, and sponges anchor on the hard surfaces of the aerial roots
* Shrimps, crabs and lobsters forage for food in the muddy sediments between mangrove roots, and a variety of fish breed in the nearby waters&#x20;
