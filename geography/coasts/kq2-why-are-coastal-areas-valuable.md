# KQ2: Why are coastal areas valuable?

## How do people use coastal areas?

### Fisheries and aquaculture

* The worldwide demand for fish has grown so much that large areas of the world's oceans are overfished
* Fisheries are areas where fish are bred and raised to meet the growing demand for fish
* 1/3 of the world's fish supply now comes from fisheries
* Aquaculture is the act of farming fish in cages or ponds near to coasts, in rivers or in converted wetlands
* Ca Mau, Vietnam is the nation's shrimp production center
  * In the 1980s, more than 60,000 hectares of mangroves were cleared for building materials, firewood, charcoal and medicinal herbs, and converted into shrimp farms
  * Areas that were cleared were already waterlogged, while the remaining mangroves protect the area from storms and coastal farming, making it ideal for shrimp farming
  * Pond are constructed from mud or concrete to hold water and shrimps
  * Production from shrimp farms rapidly accelerated in the 1990s, and the early years of the 21st center, reaching a record high to US$800 million in 2010
  * But, Vietnam's coastline is now more vulnerable to erosion from storms and pollution from pond waste

### Housing and transportation

* Housing refers to shelter provided for people
* Some people live right on the coast, in stilt houses which are houses built on stilts and connected by walkways
* The walkways allow people to move within the community
* Boats are also are common mode of transportation and help to facilitate movement
* The coast is used for day-to-day activities, like using tides to remove household waste
* Kukup is a town in Malaysia with stilt house communities
  * Air Masin is one village in Kukup with about 190 stilt houses
  * Floating fish farms are also common, selling fresh fish and other marine products (e.g. salted fish, dried prawns)
  * Boats are used by local fishermen to facilitate their fishing activities
  * There are also frequent and schedules ferry services visitors can sue to visit Air Masin
  * Over the years, Kukup has become an attractive tourist destination, with its economy largely driven by the income earned from local and foreign tourists

### Tourism and recreation

* People usually associate coasts with tourism and recreation
* Tourism involves the temporary movement of people, primarily for leisure or recreation purposes
* Recreation involves activities done for enjoyment when one is not working
* Sentosa is an example of a coastal area used for tourism and recreation
  * It is occupied by a chain of sheltered artificial beaches on its southern coast, two golf courses, a marina, and exclusive residential area on its west and an integrated resorts, Resorts World Sentosa on the north
  * ONE°15 Marina Club has world class marina facilitates. It is in a harbor with wharfs offering maintenance services for boats and yachts. It also has recreation boasting facilities
  * Resorts World Sentosa also has maximized its use of its waterfront by building its hotel, museum&#x20;
  * Had 19 million visitors in 2011, a 600% increase from 2003, fueling further developments to meet demand
  * Upgrading of transport and parking facilities, enhancement of beaches, creation of a massive lagoon, and the development of more attractions such as a boardwalk connecting Sentosa to Singapore

## Coral reefs

* Coral reefs are structure that develop at, or slightly below sea level on the seabed
* Built and made up of thousands of tiny little animals known as coral polyps, which secrete rock-like deposits of calcium carbonate to protect the soft and delicate body of the polyp
* Widely distributed, but mostly found between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn
* Coral triangle in Southeast Asia has 70,000 square kilometers, the largest area and highest biodiversity of coral reefs
* Only located at certain locations as they are fragile environments

### Environmental conditions

* Average water salinity of 34-37 parts per thousand
* A moderate amount of water movement ensures that corals receive sufficient levels of oxygen
* Sea surface temperature not lower than 17-18°C
* Clear saline water between 10-60m deep allows sufficient sunlight to penetrate, triggering algae photosynthesis
* The turbidity of the water (level of murkiness) is low enough to allow sunlight to penetrate
* Sediments may suffocate living corals

### Value

* Supports natural ecosystems, allowing a wide range of marine creatures to breed and grow
  * Support more than 25% of the earth's marine fish species
  * Are habitats, which are natural environments where plants and animals live
* Marine creatures that live around reefs provide food for larger creatures
  * Parrot fish graze on the living coral polyps
  * Larger fish and mammals also prey on the smaller creatures
* Absorb wave energy, protecting the adjacent land mass from erosion
  * But during severe storms, such as those generated by a tropical cyclone, coral reefs can be severely damaged
  * Recovery is likely to be slow, and coasts are then more prone to erosion

## Mangroves

* Mangrove species are salt-tolerant tropical or sub-tropical plant which grow in condition that most plants are unable to
* Found on the coasts of countries mostly located within the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn
* Most abundant on tropical coastlines like the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, New Guinea, northern Australia and Sundarbans in India and Bangladesh

### Environmental conditions

* Are a type of halophyte, which grows naturally in a saline environment
* Found along sheltered coasts and river estuaries with muddy and waterlogged land
* These coasts experience low energy waves that allow sediments to accumulate, including mud and plant litter which provide nutrients for mangroves to thrive
* Adaptations refer to the ability of lifeforms to adjust to changing conditions
* Pencil-like aerial breathing roots help mangroves take in oxygen during parts of the day when they are not submerged
* Prop roots firmly anchor mangroves into the soft muddy ground , ensuring that they will not be uprooted or swept away&#x20;
* Kneed roots help to trap soil which is essential for plant growth
* Mangroves have javelin shaped fruits which pierce the soft mud to germinate and grow into a sapling immediately
* Some fruits are buoyant, which allow them to float away and germinate in other coastal areas
* Mangroves are salt-tolerant and have developed ways to secrete salt, some do it through the underside of their leaves

### Value

* Stabilize shorelines&#x20;
  * The dense network of roots can absorb the energy of waves, slowing the flow of water&#x20;
  * Allow the sediments that are washed down by rivers and washed up by coasts to build up amongst mangrove roots
* Help protect coastal areas from erosion by ties, storm waves and tsunamis
  * Absorb the force of storms due to their dense root system
  * The speed of storm waves is reduced due to friction, reducing the impacts of storm waves on coasts
  * A number of coastal sites in the Indian Ocean affected by the devastating tsunami in 2004 have been replanted with mangroves to protect the coast from future tsunamis
* Breeding ground and habitat for a range of marine creature
  * Barnacles, oysters and sponges anchor on the hard surfaces of the aerial roots
  * Shrimps, crabs and lobsters forage for food int he muddy sediments between mangrove roots
  * A variety of fish breed in the nearby waters
