# KQ3: How can we manage coastal areas in a sustainable manner?

## Laws and regulations

### Limit damaging activities

* Damaging activities are activities that interrupt the functioning of natural systems
* Some of these activities include blasting coral reefs to create a channel for boats, clearing mangroves to develop fish farms, dumping waste into coastal areas or into seas, and constructing facilities such as docks and marinas that replace the natural features of a coast
* As banning these damaging activates might be costly and inefficient, many national and local government bodies instead try to limit these activities
* This is done through management that aligns with the needs and demand of people together with the nature of the coastal environment
* For example, sand dunes, which are deposits of windblown sand from the foreshore zone stabilized by plants, were often trampled on by people visiting the beach in Port Phillip
* Dune vegetation was being destroyed and the sand dunes were left exposed to wind erosion
* Houses behind the dunes were in danger of being partly buried by the large volume of sand blown by the wind
* To allow the dunes to recover, authorities fenced off the dunes and built access paths to the beach, and this decision allowed the coastal environment to recover
* However, theser fences made the beach look less attractive and do not allow visitors and residents access to all parts of the beach

### Protect coastal resources

* Protecting coastal resources is a management strategy that aims to prevent resources from being exploited or depleted
* For example, areas close to the coastline where around 90% of all marine fish are caught are vulnerable to overfishing, especially in the coral reef areas of Southeast asia, where destructive fishing methods such as blasting and poison fishing are used
* In Wakatobi National Park in Indonesia, and Goat Island Marine Reserve in New Zealand, zones have been marked off to prevent commercial fishing
* This is done through local management or establishment of a marine reserve
* Marine reserves protect marine ecosystems which allows fish and endangered species to breed and thrive
* Goat Island Marine reserve is now a tourist attraction because of its plentiful fish, there are upt to 14x more snappers within the reserve than outside of it
* However, the establishment of a marine reserve is strongly opposed by fishermen, as they see their access to a valuable resource and possible a major source of food being denied
* The potential long-term benefits of a marine reserve may not be too significant to locals who can no longer fish in an area that has supported them for a long time

### Restrict development in areas prone to natural hazards

* Natural Hazards such as tsunamis can be disastrous to natural environments and human activities
* The earthquake in Tohoku, Japan in March 2011 resulted in a tsunami that caused the death of 20,000 people, the destruction of coastal towns and the failure of nuclear power stations, resulting in a rebuilding cost of US$300 billion
* Despite the occurrence and unpredictability of natural hazards, people are still attracted to coasts
* Coasts provide natural resources such as food and building materials, and a substantial range of built services such as docks, ports, housing and recreational facilities
* But residents and investors of these areas may have to spend more in construction and maintenance, and will also need to be prepared for emergencies
* Many national government and local authorities have developed management policies to deal with the threat of natural hazards in coastal areas
* They research on how severe or widespread the problem is, plan for it and then make and enforce laws, and the laws usually involve a combination of the following strategies
* Retreat, or relocation of built structures away from areas prone to natural hazards
  * In USA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency steers development away from areas prone to flooding or coastal erosion&#x20;
* Avoidance, which includes regulating development
  * Indonesian laws restrict new farms and residence from being established on low-lying coastal areas
* Defence, such as nourishing beaches, building seawalls and replanting coastal vegetation
  * Beaches in the Netherlands are closely monitored and undergo beach nourishment when long-term erosion is identified

## Soft engineering

### Beach nourishment

* Beach nourishment slows down the erosion of beaches
* It involves using sand from an external source to replenish the sand on a depleted beach
* This sad may come from another beach or be dredged from the sea floor
* This measure can successfully change a coast into a wide, sandy beach that offers protection to the immediate inland area
* Beach material of find sand was brought in to replenish Siloso, Palawan and Tanjong beaches
* As a result, the beaches became aesthetically pleasing
* However, trucking or piping in sand can be expensive and time-consuming
* Beach nourishment projects around the world have developed problems, as coral reefs at Waikiki beach have been destroyed as sand used for beach nourishment was washed out to sea and suffocated the corals
* Re-nourished beaches can also be eroded again unless other management strategies are put in place

### Planting Mangroves&#x20;

* Planting vegetation such as mangroves can help stabilise coastlines, as mangroves absorb wave energy through their dense root system
* Their dense network of roots can absorb the energy of waves, slowing the flow of water
* The network of roots allows sediments that are washed down by rivers and washed up on coasts to build amongst mangrove roots
* The dense network of mangrove roots and the build-up of sediments can help protect coastal areas from erosion by tides, storm waves and tsunamis
* A number of coastal sites in the Indian Ocean affected by the devastating 2004 tsunami have been replanted with mangroves to protect it from further erosion from future tsunamis
* The value of maintaining and replanting mangroves is now widely recognised
* However, vegetation may take a number of years to be established before it can resist natural elements such as storms, and human elements such as trampling or even vandalism

### Stabilising dunes

* Sand dunes can be stabilized by planting grasses, and the roots of grasses anchor the sand and prevent erosion
* Matting is often put over the dunes, and young grasses are then planted into the sand through the matting
* Over time, the grasses become established, the dunes become more stable, and the matting rots away, adding more nutrients to the sand
* To prevent the dunes from being disrupted from human traffic, fences and access paths need to be built
* For example, the coast along Triton Place, Australia has vegetated sand dunes and an access fence
* However, there are costs incurred from mantaining fences and paths, with fences needing to be replaced with taller ones over time as sand accumulate
* Vegetation may take a number of years to be established before it can resist natural elements such as storms, and human elements such as trampling or even vandalism

### Encouraging coral reef growth

* Coral reefs help weaken wave energy and serve as a breeding ground and nursery for fish
* Artificial reefs can be created by placing lasting materials such as steel or concrete onto the seafloor
* Corals, together with other marine creatures and vegetation, colonise these materials and start to function as a natural reef
* Since 1996, the Maldives, which is a low-lying archipelago in the Indian ocean, has been operating a coral-growing programmed to help curb severe beach erosion on its many islands
* A structure of welded construction steel rods, 45m high, 4-8m wide and 1.5m high, has been placed off the coast of its resort island of Ihuru
* The structure is charged with low-voltage solar-generated electricity to speed up coral growth, and coral are reportedly growing 3-5 times faster than normal
* The island now sustains a large variety of corals, marine animals and organisms, and the project has received international recognition
* But, it is not easy to encourage the growth of corals, as sites need to be surveyed to ensure maximum opportunity for growth, and coral growth may be slow taking over 20-30 years before results appear
* Even then, coral growth may not be significant

## Hard engineering

### Seawalls

* Seawalls are constructed to protect coastlines against wave attack by absorbing wave energy
* Most seawalls are made of concrete or stone, and built parallel to the coast
* They have been constructed in thousands of locations across the world, for example, the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom
* But, they are costly to build and maintain as constant repairs have to be made to prevent their collapse
* They only absorb some wave energy and reflect incoming waves
* They only achieve initial success as the powerful backwash of reflected waves washes away the beach materials at the foot of and beneath the seawall, undermining the base of the seawall, leading to their collapse
* For example, a seawall along the coast of Drakes Island in England collapsed due to erosion occuring at its base

### Gabions

* Gabions are wire cages usually filled with crushed rocks, built along a shore or behind a beach to prevent or reduce coastal erosion by weakening wave energy
* They absorb wave energy better than sewalls, as the rocks allow water to filter through
* Gabions along the Andaman Coast in Thailand have successfully protected the coast from erosion
* But, the wire cages are unsightly
* Gabions are costly as they need to be maintained regularly, as they are easily corroded by seawater and damaged by excessive trampling or vandalism
* Gabions were installed in East Coast Park in Singapore when it was first reclaimed, but were removed as they were vandalized

### Breakwaters

* Breakwaters help to break the force of oncoming waves
* THey are built parallel to the coast or with one end attached to the coast
* When constructure offshore, they create a zone of calm water behind them, and materials are then deposited and build up in this zone of calm water to form beachers
* The calm water zone is often used as a sheltered harbour for boats
* Breakwaters in Almeria, Spain protect the coast form erosion
* But, they are aesthetically unappealing, and are costly to build
* They also protect the coast unevenly, as materials deposited in the zone of calm water are protected, while those located away from the breakwater are subject to wave action and possible erosion
* Breakwaters built in Portland Harbour, England, resulted in erosion and flooding problems, which affected properties, beaches and communication infrastructure

### Groynes

* Groynes are low walls constructed at right angles to the shore to retain sediment that might otherwise be removed
* These structures absorb or reduce the energy of waves and cause materials to be deposited on the updrift side of the groyne facing the longshore drift
* Groynes can help sustain or extend beach areas
* The tips of groynes are sometimes angle about 10 degrees to prevent or reduce the erosion of beach materials on the downdrift side of the growne, depending on the direction of the prevailing waves
* Groynes are used along the coast of Eastbourne, United Kingdom to maintain beaches along the coast
* But, there are unsightly and expensive to maintain
* No new materials are carried on the downdrift side which is not protected by the groyne, and longshore drift will gradually erode away the unprotected part of the beach
* Large amounts of sediments were eroded on the downdrift side of groyne in Sandy Hook, New Jersey, USA, and it was eventually demolished

### Tetrapods

* Tetrapods are four-pronged concrete structures that help dissipate wave energy
* They are stacked offshore in an interlocking position
* They allow water to pass around them rather than hit against them, unlike breakwaters or seawalls
* Hence no powerful backwash is generated, reducing the possibility of them being eroded by waves
* They are pre-casted means that they are cast into the final shape before being positioned
* Thus they can be place quickly compared to other structures which may take time to build while coasts are still under attack from waves
* Crescent city, a town on the coast of California, USA has used tetrapods for many years to defend against coastal erosion and to reduce the impact of tsunamis, which have occurred 31 time from 1993-2008
* But they are aesthetically unappealing and expensive to build, and dangerous to swimmers surfers and boaters
