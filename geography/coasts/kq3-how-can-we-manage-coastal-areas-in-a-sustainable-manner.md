# KQ3: How can we manage coastal areas in a sustainable manner?

## Laws and regulations

### Limit damaging activities

* Damaging activities are activities that interrupt the functioning of natural systems
* E.g. blasting coral reefs to create a channel for boats, clearing mangroves to develop fish farms, dumping waste into coastal areas or into seas, and constructing facilities such as docks or marinas that replace the natural features of the coast&#x20;
* As banning these damaging activities might be costly and inefficient, many national and local government bodies try to limit these activities instead
* Done through management that aligns the needs and demands of people together with the nature of the coastal environment
* Example: Sand dunes, which are deposits of windblown sand were often trampled on by people visiting the beach in Port Phillip
  * Dune vegetation was being destroyed and the sand dues were left exposed to wind erosion
  * Houses behind the dunes were in danger of being partly buried by the large volume of sand blown by the wind
  * Authorities fenced off the dunes and built access paths to the beach, allowing the coastal environment to recover
  * But, the fences made the beach look less attractive and do not allow visitors and residents access to all parts of the beach

### Protect coastal resources

* Protecting coastal resources is a management strategy that aims to prevent resources from being exploited or depleted
* Fish is an example of a coastal resources that needs to be protected
* Areas close to the coastline where around 90% of all marine fish are caught are vulnerable to overfishing, especially in the coral reefs areas of Southeast Asia where destructive fishing methods of blasting and poison fishing is used
* Example: Wakatobi National Park in Indonesia and Goat Island Marine Reserve in New Zealand
  * Zones have been marked off to prevent commercial fishing
    * Done through local management or establishment of a marine reserve
  * Marine reserve protect marine ecosystems which allows fish and endangered species to breed and thrive
  * Goat Island Marine Reserve is now a tourist attraction because of its plentiful fish, there are up to 14x more snappers within the reserve than outside it
* However, the establishment of marine reserves is strongly opposed by local fishermen as they see their access to a valuable resource, and possible a major source of food being denied
* The long term benefits of a marine reserve may not be significant to locals who can no longer fish in an area that has supported them for a long time

### Restricting development in areas prone to natural hazards

* Natural hazards such as tsunamis can be disastrous to human environments and human activities
* Despite the occurrence and unpredictability of natural hazards, people are still attracted to coasts because many of the coasts provide natual resource such as food and building materials
* Coasts also provide a substantial range of built services such as docks, ports, housing and recreational facilities
* However, residents and investors of these areas may to spend more in construction and maintenance, and will also need to be prepared for emergencies
* Many national governments and local authorities have developed management policies to deal with the threat of natural hazards in coastal areas
* They research on how severe or widespread the problem is, plan for it, then make and enforce laws
* Laws and policies usually involve a combination of the following strategies
  * Retreat, or relocation of built structures away from areas prone to natural hazards
    * In USA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) steers development away from areas prone to flooding or coastal erosion
  * Avoidance, which includes regulating development
    * Indonesian laws restrict new farms and residences from being established on low-lying coastal areas
  * Defence, such as nourishing beaches, building seawalls and replanting coastal vegetation
    * For example, beaches in the Netherlands are closely monitored and undergo beach nourishment when long-term erosion is identified

## Soft engineering

* Soft engineering involves protecting the coast using natural processes, and does not involve the construction of any physical structures

### Beach nourishment (bad)

* Beach nourishments involves using sand from an external source to replenish the sand on an depleted beach
* This sand may come from another beach or be dredged from the sea floor
* This method can successfully change a coast into a wide, sandy beach that offers protection to the immediate inland area
* Example: Beach material of fine sand was brought in to replenish Siloso, Palawan and Tanjong beaches
* â€‹As a result, the beaches became aesthetically pleasing
* But, trucking in or piping in sand can be expensive and time-consuming
* Secondly, many beach nourishment projects around the world have developed problems,&#x20;
* Example: Coral reefs at Wakiki beach have  been destroyed as sand used for beach nourishment was washed out to sea and suffocated the corals
* Thirdly, re-nourished beaches can also be eroded again unless other management strategies are in place
* As a result, the beaches became aesthetically pleasing

### Planting vegetation

* Vegetation such as mangroves can stabilise shorelines, as mangroves absorb wave energy through their dense root system
* The value of maintaining and replanting mangroves is now widely recognised
* Example: A number of coastal sites in the Indian Ocean affected by the devastating tsunami in 2004 have been replanted with mangroves to protect the coast from future tsunamis
* However, vegetation may take a number of years to be established before it can resist natural elements such as storms and human elements such as trampling or even vandalism

### Stabilizing dunes

* Sand dunes can be stabilised by planting grasses as the roots of grasses anchor the sand and prevent erosion
* Matting is often put over the dunes, and young grasses are planted into the sand through the matting
* Over time the grasses become established and the dunes become more stable and the matting rots away, adding nutrients into the sand
* Example: The coast along Triton Place, Western Australia has vegetated sand dunes and an access fence
* However, fences and footpaths need to be built to prevent the vegetated dunes from being disrupted by human traffic, and maintenance can increase costs incurred
* Fences need to be replaced with taller ones over time as the sand accumulates

### Encouraging coral reef growth

* Coral reefs help weaken wave energy and serve as a breeding ground and nursery for fish
* Artificial reefs can be created by placing lasting materials such as steel on concrete onto the sea floor
* Corals, together with other marine creatures and vegetation, colonise these materials and start to function as a natural reef
* Example: Since 1996, the Maldives has been operating a coral-growing programme to help curb severe breach erosion on its many islands
  * A structure of welded construction steel rods (45m long, 4-8m wide and 1.5m high) has been places off the coast of its island resorts of Ihuru
  * It is charged with low-voltage solar-generated electricity to speed up coral growth
  * Corals are reportedly growing 3-5x faster than normal
  * The island now sustains a large variety of corals, marine animals and organisms
  * The project has received international recognition
* But, it is not easy to encourage the growth of corals as sites need to be surveyed to ensure maximum opportunity for growth
* Coral growth may be slow taking 20-30 years before results appear, and coral growth may not be significant

## Hard engineering

* Hard engineering involves the construction of physical structures to protect coasts against the erosive power of waves

### Seawalls

* Seawalls are constructed to protect coastlines against wave attack by absorbing wave energy
* Made out of concrete or stone and built parallel to the coast
* Constructed in thousands of locations throughout the world
* Example: The Isle of Wight, United Kingdom uses seawalls to protect its coast
* But, they are costly to build and maintain as constant repairs have to be made to prevent their collapse
* Seawalls only absorb some wave energy and reflect incoming waves
* Achieve only initial sucess as the powerful backwash of reflected waves washes away the beach materials at the foot of and beneath the seawall, undermining the base, leading to their collapse
* Example: A seawall along the coast of Drakes Island in England due to erosion occurring at its base

### Gabions

* Gabions are wire cages filled with crushed rocks build along a shore or behind a beach to prevent or reduce coastal erosion by weakening the wave energy
* Absorb wave energy better than seawalls as the gaps between the rocks allow water to filter through
* Example: Gabions along the Andaman Coast, Thailand successfully protect the coast from erosion
* But, the wire cages are unsightly
* They are costly as they need to be maintained regularly
* They are easily corroded by seawater and damaged by excessive trampling or vandalism
* Example: Gabions were installed when the East Coast Park in Singapore was first reclaimed, but were removed as they were vandalised

### Breakwaters

* Breakwaters help break the force of oncoming waves, and are built parallel to the coast or with one end attached to the coast
* When constructed offshore, breakwaters create a zone of calm water behind them, where materials are deposited and built up in this zone to form beaches
* The calm water zone is often sued as a sheltered harbour for boats
* Example: Breakwaters at Almeria, Spain, successfully protect the coast from erosion
* But, they are aesthetically unappealing and costly to build
* They protect the coast unevenly as materials deposited in the zone behind the breakwater are protected while zones located away are subjected to possible erosion&#x20;
* Example: Breakwaters built in Portland Harbour, England resulted in erosion and flooding problems, affecting properties, beaches and communication infrastructure

### Groynes

* Groynes are law walls constructed at right angles to the shore to retain sediments that might otherwise be removed due to longshore drift
* Absorb or reduce the energy of the waves and cause materials to be deposited on the updrift side of the groyne facing the longshore drift
* But, they are unsightly and expensive to build and maintain
* No new materials are carried and deposited on the downdrift side which is not protected by the groyne, and longshore drift will gradually erode away the unprotected part of the beach
* Example: Large amounts of sediments were eroded on the downdrift side of a groyne build along Sandy Hook in New Jersey, USA
* The tips of groynes are angled about 10 degrees to prevent the erosion of beach materials on the downdrift side of the groyne,  depending on the direction of the prevailing winds

### Tetrapods

* Tetra pods are four-pronged concrete structures that help dissipate wave energy
* Stacked offshore in an interlocking position
* Allow water to pass around them rather than hit against them, and no powerful backwash is generated, reducing the possibility of tetra pods being damaged  by waves
* They are pre-casted, meaning they are cast into their final shape before being positioned
* Can be placed quickly compared to other structures, which may take time to build while coasts are still under attack form waves
* Example: Cresent city, a town on the coast of Northern California, has used tetra pods for many years to defend against coastal erosion and to reduce the impact of tsunamis, which occurred 31 times between 1933-2008
* But they are aesthetically unappealing and expensive to build, and dangerous to swimmers, surfers and boaters.
