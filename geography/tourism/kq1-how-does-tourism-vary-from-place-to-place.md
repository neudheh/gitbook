# KQ1: How does tourism vary from place to place?

* Tourists are people that travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for more than 24 hours, but not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes
* International tourism is tourism outside of ones own country, while domestic tourism refers to tourism within one's own country

## Places of scenic beauty

* Many of the earth's natural environments have become major tourist destinations
* E.g. mountains, rivers valleys, deserts, waterfalls, coral reefs rainforests
* These places attract tourists with their awe-inspiring scenery, and are different from the built environments of towns and cities where many tourists come from
* Provide opportunities for mountaineering, hiking, cycling and swimming
* Mountainous areas have unique combinations of vegetation, wildlife, weather and high altitude that draw mountaineers (Rocky Mountains in North America and Himalayas in South Asia)
* Tropical coastal resorts are popular amongst tourists who want to escape the cold winters of Europe and North America (Phuket in Thailand and Cancun in Mexico)

### Honeypot tourism

* Honeypot tourism refers to tourism that attracts large numbers of people due to a site's scenic beauty
* Tend to become overcrowded during peak seasons
* Tourist facilities such as hotels, shopping centres and transport stations are developed at these sites, like bees to flowers, hence the term honeypot
* Example: Victoria falls is located on the Zambezi River on the boundary of Zimbabwe and Zambia in Africa
  * Between April- June when the flow of water in the Zambezi river is the greatest, the falls are 1.7 kilometres wide, and spill into a plunge pool that is more than 100m deep
  * The beauty of the rising mist and the roar of the falling water attract an average of 300,000 visitors a year

## Roles of different groups in promoting tourism

### International organisations

* Reports produced by international organisations can encourage of discourage tourists in vising a place
* E.g. the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Tourism committee, the UNTWO and the WHO
* Example: UNESCO world heritage sites conserves sites of cultural and heritage importance, and prevents them form being developed on and at the same time bringing international attention to these locations by showcasing them as a potential destination for heritage tourism
  * Prior to the Botannical gardens being given this status, it had 4.4 million visitors in 2012
