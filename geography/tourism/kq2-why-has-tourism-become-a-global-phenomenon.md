# KQ2: Why has tourism become a global phenomenon?

## International tourism

* Generally, tourism rates have been increasing
* A major trend is that tourism in the Asia pacific region is having an increased market share, even more than North and South America
* Whereas, tourism in North America, South America and Europe have been on the decline
* Regions like Europe and North America, being the most developed countries, have tourist flows of >10 million, more than 1/2 of all international tourists
* Increasingly, there are more international tourists from rapidly developing countries in Asia Pacific and South America
* Europe recieves slightly more than half of all international tourst arrivals at 504 million
* ASia Pacifi is the second highest at about 217 million, followed bt the americas at about 157 million
* Resulted in huge increase in tourist dollars

## Domestic tourism

* Domestic tourism refers to tourism within one's own country
* Domestic tourism continues to be the most popular form of tourism, despite the immense growth of all international tourism over the last 60 years
* Accounted for 83% of all tourist arrivals in 2010
* Domestic tourism receipts amount to more than international tourism

## Forms of tourism

### Mass tourism

* Mass tourism refers tp travel that involves large numbers of toruists visitng a particular place together
* Often in the form of a package holiday, a major form of holidays since the 1970s
  * Torusi is arranged by a travel agent
  * Accomdation and most meals are included in the package
  * Serce of guides who speak the local language, who are usually knowledgeable about the sites, habits and culture and history of the places to be visited
* Rose due to increased affluence and lesiure time

### Niche tourism

* Niche torusim refers to special-interest toruism based on a particular area, intrest or activity
* Can be done by independet traveller or as part of a package holiday
* Appeals to those who seek 'new' destinations, activities and experiences
* Examples
  * Special interests: Whale watching in Hawaii
  * Adventure holidays: Whitewater rafting and bungee jumping in New Zealand
* Ecotourism is a form of niche toursim
* Defined as responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the envrionment and improves the wellbeing of local people
* Aims:
  * To help travellers better appreciate natural beauty and biodiversity
  * Providing funds for ecological conservation
  * Enabling tousim to directly benefit local communities involved in tourism

  * Build environmental and cultural awareness and respect
  * Build positive experiences for both visitors and hosts
  * Provide direct financial benefits for conservation
  * Provide direct financial benefits for empowerment of local people
  * Raise sensitivity to host country's political, environmental and social climate
* Example: Waitomo caves in New Zealand
  * Type of torusim: Ecotourism, place of scenic beauty because of the glowworms that light the cave's ceiling and caving
  * Manage by the New Zealand government with the Maori People of New Zealand
  * Maori People who own the caves recieve income from being employed and the entrance fees -> provide direct financial benefits for empowerment of local people
  * Managers closely monitor conditions within the cave to ensure minimal human impact on the environemnt (e.g. tour operations are stopped if CO2 levels reach 2400 parts per million, and controlling the number of tourists who enter the caves)

## Short haul destinations

* Refers to destinations that are a short distance away from the tourist's home coutnry, reachable by car, train, bus or flight of generally less than 5h
* Example: Hong Kong to Singapore has a flight time of less than 4 hours long

## Long haul destinations

* Refers to destinations that are a long distance away from the tourist's home country, reachable by a flight of genearlly 5h or more
* Example: Europe to Singapore has a flight time of about 12-15 horus

## Reasons for the growth of tourism

### Developments in technology

#### Better and more affordable transport

* Developments in technology have led to greater improvements in safety, shorter traveling time, lower traveling costs, and more affordable for the average person
* Example: Commercial air travel has revolutionized global tourism due to ongoing technological developments in jet aircraft since the 1950s
  * In the 1950s, most commercial planes would fly short distances and stop to refill, sometimes overnight
  * A flight from Singapore to London would take 4 days with many stopovers at different cities, and it could only carry 36 passengers
  * Now, airplanes can fly non-stop for 15,000km and travel at 800-1000km/h
  * A commercial flight from Singapore to London now takes around 14h, and can now carry 853 passengers
* The rise of budget airlines, or airlines with low fairs has made air transport affordable
* Rapidly expanded within Europe, North and South America and Southeast Asia since the 1980s
* Cheaper than major airlines because of smaller and more fuel efficient aircraft, they only fly to short-haul destination, and tickets are sold online rather than travel agents
* Example: Jetstar Asia and AirAsia
* Increase the number of international travelers by&#x20;
  * Enabling more people to travel internationally and more frequently
  * Giving travelers the opportunity to go on holidays farther away from home
  * Go to destinations not covered by major airlines (e.g. Bhutan, Pacific Islands, Northern Thailand)

#### Ease of access to information

* Developments in information technology have made information more readily available and more accessible
* It also has made available updated information
* Online booking and research
  * Enables traveler to buy their own tickets without going through travel agents
  * Gives tourists more options and control
  * Gives tourists better aces to information at their destination. including places to see, social etiquette to observe and train timetables
  * Allows travelers to view feedback and recommendations from other travelers
  * Enables travelers to do research to find out more about their destinations
* Surveillance, electronic check and other safety control research
  * Makes tourists feel safer and more confident about traveling

### Demand factors

#### Disposable income

* Disposable income is the amount of income left to an individual after taxes have been paid
* Amount of income available for saving and spending
* The growth in income has allowed people to spend more on goods, services or activities that improve their quality of life
* Disposable income has been increasing globally because of rapid economic growth
* Countries such as China and India has experienced rapid economic growth, the number of people in the middle income and high income groups has been growing -> more disposable income

#### Leisure time

* Leisure time is when people are free from work responsibilities and commitments
* For the middle to high income groups, leisure time usually comes in the form of paid leave
* In many DCs and LDCs since the 1950s, people in all income groups have enjoyed shorter working weeks, more public holidays and more paid annual leave
* With more income and paid leave/ increased availability of leisure time, more people are inclined to travel
* Example: In Australia, many employees can exchange paid overtime work for leave. This increases the chances of taking longer weekend breaks
  * In Canada, there has been an increase in additional breaks and extended weekends

#### Changing lifestyle

* Changing lifestyle refers to the change in the way people live throughout their lifetime and from generation to generation
* The pace of life today is much faster, with many people finding themselves spending long hours at the workplace beyond official working hours
* This makes travelling a way for people to relax and take a break from their fast-paced lifestyles at work
* Advances in medical technology and knowledge caused people to be more health-conscious and lead healthier lifestyles -> live longer and more physically fit to travel frequently
* Travelling has become a way for retirees to spend the remainder of their healthy years productively
* Retirees are major contributors to the growth of tourism
* Cruises are popular with them, with many going on cruise ships in the Caribbean and Mediterranean
* Example: In Australia there is a group of retirees called the grey nomads who spend much of their time travelling in mobile homes or vehicles with four-wheel drive to explore remote parts of the country, and have become a familiar sight on roads and campsites in the outback

### Destination factors

#### Attractions

* An attraction is a feature or a quality that makes a place interesting or enjoyable
* This attraction is often promoted and enhanced by the tourism industry to attract even more tourists
* Some attractions are natural while others a built
  * Places of scenic beauty are natural attractions
  * Medical services, educational facilities and theme parks are built attractions
* Without these attractions, tourists are less likely to visit a place
* Example: Dubai, a city in the UAE in the middle east has become a major destination and stopover location between Europe and Asia
  * Two of Dubai's most well known attractions are the Burj Al Arab, a 'seven-star' luxury hotel built on an artificial island and the Palm Islands, the world's largest artificial islands for high-end residential, leisure and entertainment facilities
  * Received more than 15 million travelers in 2017
* Offer something spectacular, unique and interesting for tourists and hope they return repeatedly to sped tourist dollars

#### Investment in infrastructure and services

* Tourist attractions require large investments in infrastructure and services
* Infrastructure refers to the transport and communication networks, electrical frameworks and systems for water and waste disposal
* Airport expansion and development is a type of infrastructure needed for tourism, as fewer tourist would visit a place if its airport cannot manage the growth in air passenger traffic
* Example: Changi Airport's budget terminal was closed down in September 2012 to make way for the construction of terminal 4, which officially opened in October 2017, raising the airport's total capacity to 82 million from only 73 million in 2013
* Sufficient hotels must be built to accommodate tourists, making accommodation another type of infrastructure
* Example: Hong Kong will had another 49 hotels to its 189 operating ones in 2012, accommodating a potential rise of visitors form 42 million to 70 million a year
* Services are a particular type of help or work that is provided by businesses
* Tourist sites require food outlet, entertainment and telecommunication links to other places in the world, as well as trained personnel (hotel managers, guides, travel agents, drivers, porters, cleaners, restaurateurs)
* Example: The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has worked with the Society of Tour Guides to bring in internationally accredited training programs to enhance the skills of local tour guides and help them become better storytellers

#### Access to information

* Access to information refers to the ease with which information can be obtained
* Tourists are more likely to visit a destination when travel- related information is easy to obtain, both inside and outside and within a destination
* Example: transport routes and schedules, weather conditions and available accommodation
* Tourists also want to have access to information in a language they can understand
* Local tour guides and travel agent should be trained to answer questions and help meet the needs of tourists
* They should also have knowledge of the place’s history, local geography and culture
* Example: Signs found in many tourist destinations are displayed in many different languages

## Reasons for the fluctuations in tourism

### Disasters

* Disasters are events that cause great damage to properties, lead to injuries, or cause great loss of life
* Can discourage tourists from visiting a destination because it poses greater risks to the safety of tourists and may disrupt essential tourist infrastructure
* Example: The 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan caused a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown in the country’s Tohoku region and as a result, international tourist arrivals decreased 28% to 6.2 million  as compared to the start of the year
* Tourists were afraid of going to Japan as a result of the nuclear meltdown and hence tourist rates were negatively impacted by the disaster

### Recessions

* A recession is a period of general slowdown in economic activities
* People typically experience a loss of income or jobs  → causes people to cut back on spending → decline in demand for good and services → fewer international tourists
* People choose to go for domestic tourism as the shorter distance means lesser spent on transportation → more affordable option to travel
*   Domestic tourism is also promoted by tourist organizations during a recession as it encourages people to contribute to their own country’s economy

    | A recession is regional when it affects only a region or a group of countries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | A recession is global when it affects many countries around the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Political situations

* Unfavorable political situations such as political conflicts may discourage tourists from visiting
* Political situations refers to a state of disagreement between different groups of people that may result in wars
* Pose dangers to tourists as well as residents → tourists may postpone or cancel their travel plans
* Government may also issue travel advisories, which are official notes that discourage citizens from travelling to a particular region or country
* Example: Libyan Civil War in 2011
* Civil war was taking place in Libya during that period, which may pose dangers to civilian lives and the safety of tourists
* Many governments banned their citizens from going to Libya
* Almost no commercial flights into Libya's airspace and hence no tourist arrivals by air

### Diseases

* An outbreak of diseases refers to the sudden and widespread occurrence of disease in an area
* Tourist do not want to risk getting infected with a contagious disease → huge drop in tourist arrivals
* Government agencies may also advise travellers to avoid areas with disease outbreaks
* Cause businesses to postpone or cancel large-scale MICE activities
* Example: A SARS outbreak spread over 6 months in 2003, killing 775 people and infecting more than 8,000 in 25 countries. Hong Kong was identified as a key area for SARS transmissions was blacklisted as an infected country, and the resulted panic caused hotel occupancy to drop from the usual 82% to 15%
