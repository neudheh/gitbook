# KQ2: Why has tourism become a global phenomenon?

## Trends in the global tourism industry

### International tourism

* Since the 1980s international tourism has become increasingly diverse in its origins and destinations
* One major trend is that the Asia Pacific region has increased in popularity as a tourist destination
  * Tourist arrivals in Asia Pacific region grew from 8.2% in 1980 to 21.7% in 2010
  * Asia Pacific region is the fastest growing region for international tourism
  * Since 2004, Asia Pacific has overtaken North and South America
  * It is the second most visited visited region after Europe
* Most of the tourists come from developed countries, but now more tourists are coming from asia pacific and south america
  * More than half of all international tourists still originate from the world's most developed countries in Europe and North America
  * Increasingly more international tourists form rapidly developing countries in Asia Pacific and South America
* Huge increase in the amount of tourist dollars created due to global tourism

### Domestic tourism

* Domestic tourism has grown along with international tourism
* Domestic tourism continues to be the most popular form of tourism
  * In 2010, 83% of all tourist arrivals were from domestic tourism, and 69% of all overnight stays in hotels were from domestic tourism
* Domestic tourism receipts amount to more than international tourism receipts
  * In the Philippines in 2010, international tourism receipts were US$3..2 billion while domestic tourism receipts were US$22.9 billion

## Evolution of mass tourism to niche tourism

* Mass tourism refers to travel that involves large numbers of tourists visiting a particular place together
* It often takes the form of a package holiday, which involve a tour usually arranged by a travel agent, with transportation, accommodation and most meals included in the package
* Package holidays also include the service of guides who speak the local language and are knowledgeable about the sites, habits, culture and history of the places to be visited
* Niche tourism refers to a special interest-tourism based on a particular area, interest or activity
* It can be done by independent travellers or combined with package tours
* It appeals to travellers who seek 'new' destinations, activities and experience
* E.g. Whale-watching in Hawaii (Special interests) and White-water rafting in New Zealand (adventure holidays)

### Ecotourism

* Ecotourism is a form of niche tourism
* It is defined as responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people
* The International Ecotourism Society outlined 6 principles of ecotourism
  * Minimise impact
  * Build environmental and cultural awareness and respect
  * Provide positive experience for both visitors and hosts
  * Provide direct financial benefits for conservation
  * Provide financial benefits and empowerment of local people
  * Raise sensitivity to host countries' political, environmental and social climate
* Involves visiting relatively undisturbed natural areas to help traveller better appreciate natural beauty and biodiversity, and to gain funds for ecological conservation
* Waitomo Caves in New Zealand is a famous tourist destination that light the caves' ceiling, and it is an example of ecotourism
* Tours to the caves are managed in partnership with the local Maori
* Its managers closely monitor conditions within the cave to ensure minimal human impact on its internal environment
* A scientific advisory committee was hired to help monitor the cave and recommend best tourism practices
* Tour operations are closely monitored and halted if carbon dioxide levels reach 2,400 parts per million, as it would become corrosive to the caves at that level
* The managers also control the number of tourists who enter the caves
* Tours to the caves benefit the local Maori, who own the caves and receive a portion of the entrance fees
* They also receive income from being employed as part of the cave staff

## Short haul VS long haul destinations

* Short-haul destinations refer to destinations that are a short distance away from the tourist's home country, usually reachable by car, bus, train or a flight of generally less than 5 hours
* Hong Kong is a short-haul destination from Singapore
* Long-haul destinations refer to destination that are a long distance away from the tourist's home country, reachable by a flight generally 5 hours or more
* Europe is a long-haul destination from Singapore

## Reasons for the growth of global tourism

### Developments in technology

#### Better and affordable transport

* Developments in technology have led to greater improvements in safety, shorter travelling time and lower travelling costs for the average person
  * Ongoing technological developments in jet aircraft means more affordable commercial airfare, revolutionising global tourism
  * In the 1950s, most commercial airplanes would fly short distances and stop the refuel, but now airplanes can fly non-stop for 15,000 kilometers and travel at 800-1000 km/h
  * Flying from Singapore to London used to take 2-4 days, but with the Airbus 380, a non-stop flight now takes about 14 hours
* The rise of budget airlines, or airlines with low fares has made transport more affordable
  * Budget airlines rapidly expanded within Europe, North and South America, and southeast Asia since the 1980s
  * Cheaper as they have smaller and more fuel-efficient aircrafts that fly short-haul destinations
  * Costs are further reduced by selling tickets online, rather than through travel agents
  * E.g. Jetstar Asia and AirAsia
  * Enabled more people to travel internationally and frequently&#x20;
  * Gives traveller the opportunity to go on holidays farther away from home
  * Enabled travelers to go to destinations not covered by major commercial airlines

#### Ease of access to information

* Developments in information technology have made information more readily available and accessible
* It also has made available updated information
* This ease of access to information has helped promote air travel and global tourism
* Online booking and research&#x20;
  * Enables travellers to buy their own tickets without going through travel agent, possibly saving costs
  * Gives tourists more options and control
  * Better access to information at their destination, including places to see, social etiquettes to observe and train timetables
  * Allows travellers to view feedback and recommendations from other travelers&#x20;
  * Enables them to do research to find out more about their destinations
* Surveillance, electronic checks and other safety controls research makes tourists feel safer and more confident about travelling

### Demand factors

#### Disposable income

* Disposable income is the amount of income left to an individual after taxes have been paid, and is the amount of income available for saving and spending
* The growth in income has allowed people to spend more on goods, services or activities that improve their quality of life
* Disposable income has been increasing globally because of rapid economic growth
* Countries such as China and INdia have experience rapid economic growth, and the number of people in the middle income and high income groups have been growing

#### Leisure time

* Leisure time is the time when people are free from work responsibilities and commitments
* For middle and high income groups, leisure time  comes in the form of paid leave
* With more income and paid leave, these people feel more inclined to travel
* In DCs and LDCs, people in all income groups have enjoyed shorter working weeks, more public holidays and more paid annual leave
* The increased ability of leisure time has allowed more people to travel
* In Australia, many employees can exchange paid overtime work for leave, and in Canada, there is an increase in additional breaks and additional breaks and extended weekends

#### Changing lifestyles

* Changing lifestyles refers to the change in the way people live throughout their lifetime and from generation to generation
* The pace of life today is much faster, and many people in the workforce find themselves spending long hours at the workplace beyond the official working hours
* Travelling has become a way for people to relax and take a break from their fast-paced lifestyles at work
* Due to advances in medical technology and knowledge, people are now more health-conscious and lead healthier lifestyles, hence they live longer and are more physically fit to travel frequently
* Retirees are major contributors to the growth of tourism
* In Australia, there is a group of retirees called the grey nomads, who spend much of their time travelling in mobile homes or vehicles with four-wheel drive to explore remote parts of the country
* They are a familiar sight on roads and campsites in the outback

### Destination factors

#### Attractions

* An attraction is a feature or quality that makes a place interesting or enjoyable
* The attraction is often promoted or enhanced by the tourism industry to attract more tourists
* They can offer something spectacular, unique and interesting for both domestic and international tourists, and can get them to return repeatedly to spend their tourist dollars
* Some attractions are natural, like places of scenic beauty, while others are built, like medical services or theme parks
* Two of Dubai's most well known attractions are the Burj Al Arab, a 7-star luxury hotel built on an artificial island and the Palm Islands, the world's largest artificial island for high-end residential, leisure and entertainment facilities
* This caused Dubai to receive 15 million travellers in 2017

#### Investments in infrastructure and services

* Tourist attractions require large investments in infrastructure and services
* Infrastructure refers to transport and communication networks, electrical frameworks and system for water and waste disposal
  * A type of transportation infrastructure needed for tourism is airport expansion and development, as fewer tourists would visit a place if its airport cannot manage the growth in air passenger traffic
  * Changi Airport's budget terminal was close down in september 2012 to make way for terminal 4, which opened in 2017, raising the total capacity to 82 million
  * Another type of infrastructure needed is accommodation, as sufficient hotels must be built to receive the rising number of tourists
  * Hong Kong will add another 49 hotels to its 189 existing ones, to accomodate a potential rise in visitors form 42 million a year to 70 million a year
* Services are a particular type of help or work that is provided by a business to customers
  * Tourist sites require food outlets, entertainment and telecommunication links to other places in the world
  * The Singapore Tourism Board Worked with the Society of Tourist Guides (Singapore) to bring in internationally accredited training programmes to enhance the skills of guides here and make them better storytellers

#### Access to information

* This refers to the ease with which information can be obtained
* Tourists are more likely to visit a destination when travel-related information is easy to obtain, both outside and within a destination
* E.g. Transport routes and schedules, weather conditions, available accomodation
* Tourists also want access to information in a language they can understand
* Local tour guides and travel agents should be trained to answer questions and help meet the needs of tourists

## Why is tourism subject to fluctuations?

### Disasters

* Disasters are events that cause great damage to properties, lead to injuries or cause great loss of life
* A disaster can discourage tourists from visiting a destination as it poses greater risks to the safety of tourists and may disrupt essential tourist infrastructure
* In March 2011, Japan experienced an earthquake which caused a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown in the Tohoku region
* By the end of 2011, Jpanas total tourist arrivals had decreased by 28% to 6.2 million tourist arrivals
* Disaster can also discourage the citizens of the affected country from travelling overseas

### Recessions

* A recession is a period of general slowdown in economic activities
* In a recession, many people experience a loss of income or jobs
* This decline in income causes people to cut back on spending
* This leads to a decline in demand for goods and services
* People are less likely to travel overseas during a recession, leading to fewer international tourists
* Many people may choose to go for holidays in their own country, rather than travel abroad during a recession
* A regional recession only affects a region or a group of countries, for example, the European Sovereign debt Crisis
* A global recession affects many countries around the world, for example the Global Financial Crisis, which stated when some of the world's largest financial firms went bankrupt in 2007 and 2008
* This caused the number of international visitors in France to fall by nearly one-third

### Political Situations

* Unfavourable political situations may discourage tourists from visiting
* Political conflicts refer to a state of disagreement between different groups of people that may result in wars
* This poses dangers to tourists and residents, and may disrupt services and infrastructure, causing tourists to postpone or cancel their plans
* Due to the dangers of conflicts, government authorities may also issue travel advisories, which are official notices that discourage citizens from travelling to a particular region or country
* For example, when the Arab Spring Uprising hit Egypt in 2011, Tourist arrivals declined sharply from 14.7 million to 9.8 million&#x20;

### Diseases

* An outbreak of disease refers to the sudden and widespread occurrence of diseases
* Tourists do not want to risk getting infected with an infectious disease, causing a huge drop in tourist arrivals
* Government agencies may also issue travel advisories, advising travellers to avoid areas with disease outbreaks
* The SARS outbreak spanned over 6 months in 2003, killin 775 people and infecting more than 8,000 in 25 countries, causing Singapore's visitors arrivals to decrease by nearly 70% for the most of April 2003, devastating the tourism sector
