# KQ3: Developing tourism at what cost?

## Economic impacts

### Advantages

#### Employment opportunities

* Employment is work performed for a wage or salary, in cash or in kind
* The growth of tourism has let to an increase in the number of tourism-related jobs
* The tourism industry offers many employment opportunities, including workers in hotels, transportation, souvenir shops and tour agencies
* Some jobs are directly linked to the tourism industry, e.g. travel agents, tour guides, hotel staff, waiters and waitresses
* Others are indirectly linked to the tourism industry, e.g. taxi drivers and shop owners
* In 2011, the tourism industry employed over 235 million people worldwide (6-8% of all the jobs in the world)

#### Growth in income

* Tourism growth can lead to growth in income for individuals and a country
* Fishermen on Pamilacan Island in the philippines are hired by tour companies to take tourists on their boats to look for and swim with whale sharks and dolphins
* They are paid between US$80-100 per boat for their service
* This would be additional income on top of their fishing livelihood, while tour companies will experience an increase in revenue
* There will be an overall increase in revenue for the country through taxes collected from the fishermen and tour companies
* Tourism recipes are the money receive from tourism spending, and generate large revenue for many countries
* in 2011, worldwide tourism receipts exceeded US$1 trillion
* A large portion of revenue from tourism is sometimes lost as leakage, especially in LDCs
* Leakage occurs when revenue earned from tourism is paid to other countries for the import of goods and services needed to meet the needs of tourists
* In Phuket, Thailand, when traveller use the services of foreign-owned businesses and buy imported items, and some of the profits made by local businesses are sent to another country to pay for imports
* Money spent by tourists does not stay in the local economy and bring only a few benefits to local businesses and workers

#### Development in infrastructure and facilities

* Infrastructure development is the construction of transport and communication networks, electrical frameworks and systems for water and waste disposal
* Tourism cannot develop and would not be able to operate on a large scale without sufficient infrastructure and appropriate facilities
* E.g. Airports, roads, electricity, hotels
* Infrastructure built to enhance tourism brings benefits to the locals
* Roads that link airports cities and tourists sites allow tourists access to local attraction, and allow locals better access to markets, healthcare, education and jobs
* The development of infrastructure creates employments for local workers as many workers are needed during the construction process
* Local industries are also boosted as local materials may be used to construct the infrastructure
* It encourages economic growth due to increased spending in the local economy

### Disadvantages

#### Seasonal unemployment

* Certain tourist activities depend on climactic conditions
* Countries may experience regular fluctuations in tourist numbers
* People in tourism-related jobs have to find other sources of income when employment is temporarily unavailable
* Sapporo, Japan receives a large number of visitors from December to February, many of whom engage in winter sports
* Mountain ski resort operators employ more people during winter to cater to the high tourist demand
* In other seasons, workers return to other jobs like faming, or move away temporarily until the next tourist season

#### Underuse of facilities

* Underused facilities can be costly to maintain
* Money from tourists normally pays for the cost of maintenance
* Facilities may become neglected when there are a few tourists
* The venues for the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, are allegedly deteriorating years after the olympics
* Some were renovated to become more profitable, like the Beijing National Aquatics Center was renovated into a water park
* Only 1/3 of major sport venues in China have managed to break even

#### Shortage of services

* Tourist infrastructure may require the use of large amount of land, water and power
* This could lead to a shortage of services, such as water supplies of power in non-tourist areas
* Large amounts of water are required to water the grass on golf courses and fill swimming pools, and drinking water for nearby residents could be diverted to meet the needs of tourist infrastructure
* Large amounts of electricity are required to power tourist facilities, and locals can suffer a shortage of water or power when they cannot afford to pay as much as the tourists

## Socio-cultural impacts

### Advantages

#### Preservation of culture and local customs

* The preservation of culture is the protection of the way people live, including their economic activities, traditional beliefs and religious practices
* Could apply to heritage and customs
* Heritage is the traditional beliefs, values and customs of a family, country of society
* Customs are the traditional ways of behaving or doing things that are specific to a particular society
* Preserved and restores sites are more attractive to tourists
* They benefit the local population by enhancing people's sense of history, building a sense of belonging to the community
* Tourism revenue can be used to fund the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage, e.g. entry fee to Angkor Wat

### Disadvantages

#### Dilution of culture and local customs

* Identity, culture and values of a place can be lost when tourism becomes the major activity of an area
* Tourism-oriented commercial activities (e.g. food outlets, travel agencies, souvenir shops) can overwhelm an area
* Buildings may be modified or built to accommodate tourism
* Locals may relocate elsewhere, which changes the original atmosphere, appearance and functions of the area they left
* Local cultural festivals are also sometimes modified to meet the demands and expectations of tourists
* Dancers deliberately pose for tourist photographs
* Rituals are shortened to fit into the itenary of tourists, and repeated several times a day
* The authenticity and significant of the cultural events are reduced because of commercialisation
* Tourists pay a hefty fee to enter the village of the Kayan Lahwi women, causing tourists to treat the women as exhibits they have paid for, aggressively taking photographs of the women without permission

#### Increased crime

* Tourists carry valuable items such as watches and cameras
* They are prone to being mugged, cheated or scammed in tourist areas or tourist traps
* Tourist traps are places where information goods or services are sold are greatly inflated prices
* They also can refer to places where tourist scams are common
* These can deter tourists from visiting
* Many countries have police to help server tourists and sort out conflicts with locals over purchases
* In 2010, Japanese tourists were scammed by a woman pretending to be a tourist
  * The woman would ask for directions and ask to have a photo taken, while her accomplices would appear and pose as police officers requesting for the group's identification and credit cards
  * The woman would hand over her identification and credit card and convinced the tourists to do the same
  * Once the credit cards are handed over, they would be used to withdraw money from the atm or buy expensive things

## Environmental impacts

### Advantages

#### Conservation of natural environments

* Funding from tourism helps protect and conserve environments such as coral reefs, rainforests and mountainous areas
* This can be collected from the revenue form entrance fees to national parks and diving sites, and levis on accommodation
* The Sepilok Orang-utan Rehabilitation Centre partly relies on visitors entry fees to pay staff, who help rehabilitate Orang-utans that have been orphaned on injured

### Disadvantages

#### Increased congestion

* There may be increased congestion due to large number of tourists near popular attractions
* Tourists shops and accommodations that cluster  near tourists attractions due to the large crowd, making ti even more congested
* This also causes vehicular and pedestrian traffic to be goncested as well
* The huge inflow of cars and pedestrians can contribute to air pollution
* In Rome, Italy, many older walkways and narrow streets are filled with tourists

#### Vandalism

* Vandalism is the crime of deliberately damaging property belonging to other people
* Cultural, historical or natural sites may be vandalised by individuals or developers
* Thousand of stones and bricks of the great Wall of china are covered with graffiti

#### Pollution and littering

* Pollution and littering is a major problem that degrades tourist areas
* Authorities sometimes fail to implement measures that would properly manage waste let being by tourists
* Tourists on cruise ships in the Caribbean Sea dump plastic bottles, food packaging and old batteries overboard from cruise ships
* Solid and liquid waste are sometimes dumped into the sea by ships, hence harbours, marinas and the ocean become  polluted

#### Destruction of habitats

* Popular tourist sites can be overwhelmed with visitors during buys times of the year, e.g. beaches and villages
* When too many tourists visit a destination, they may destroy habitats and wildlife
* Carless tourists trample on plants, while others collect eggs and feathers of birds as souvenirs
* These tourist make too much noise, which can disturb and frighten off animals
* Egypt's Red sea is a major diving and snorkelling destination for around 1.2 million visitors annually
* Habitats of coral reefs and exotic fish have been damages, as swimmers collect shells and corals as souvenirs, and hotels and restaurants sometimes dump waste and sewage into the sea

#### Increased carbon footprint

* The Carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that would be produced by activates that involve the use of fossil fuels
* Measured in equivalent amounts in carbon dioxide
* Activities may include travelling by planes and tour buses, and electricity consumption by hotels
* A one-way economy class flight from SIngapore to Kuala Lumpur generates 30kg of carbon dioxide per passenger

## Sustainable tourism

* Sustainable tourism is a form of tourism organised in a way that allows it to continue without causing damage to the environment or without leaving negative impacts on the surrounding society and culture
* It addresses the needs of visitors, industries and host communities

### Laws and regulations

* Conservation is the careful management and use of resources such that these resources would not deplete
* It is important for fragile environments (environments that are easily affected by change e.g. mangroves, coral reefs)
* They can be disturbed by dumping of waste from tourist facilities, removal of vegetation to build roads and buildings, and the disposal of waste into rivers, lakes or coastal environments )
* A well protected environment attracts more tourists to visit, and previous tourists to return
* The arrival or tourists will benefit the locals economically and motivate them to care for the sites properly
* The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the world's longest complex of coral reefs and small islands
  * It stretches 2,300km along the northeast coast of Australia
  * But, this made it threatened by tourism activities, such as fuel leaks from pleasure boats, particularly in marinas and harbours, and the removal of corals for souvenirs
  * The diverse ecosystem and beauty that gave the reefs its place on UNESCO's world Heritage List in 1981, making it protected by laws and regulations
  * Thus there has been laws and regulations in&#x20;
    * limiting the number of people who entrer
    * restricting expansion of the ports
    * creating marine reserves
    * work with farmers to reduce sediment runoff into the ocean
    * put more farms into conservation
    * strict laws against dredging activities or any other damaging activities
  * UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisations) is involved in conservation, and responsible for declaring sites as 'World Heritage'
  * They provide funding for conserve threatened sites
  * The number of world heritage sites increased from 12 in 1978 to almost 1,000 in 2012

### Support from the local people

* Sustainable tourism also involves minimising leakage from tourist revenues through support from local people
* Different strategies are adopted to reduce leakages
  * Training locals to perform skilled tourism jobs e.g. management, marketing
  * Developing homestay accommodations where visitors can pay local directly for their accommodation
  * Promoting local food and drinks to provide a market for local food producers and distributors&#x20;
  * Example in [#local-communities](kq3-developing-tourism-at-what-cost.md#local-communities "mention")

## Tensions in managing the impacts of tourism

### Tourists and locals

* The needs of tourists may conflict with the needs of locals, for example, Tourists wearing skimpy clothing may go against conservative values of locals
* Bali, indonesia is visited by many tourists for its natural landscape and food
* It its a world heritage site, and is renowned for its cultural landscape with Hindu temples, art, dance and other heritage and customs
* In 2012, 2.9 million international tourist visited bali
* Tourist sites such as Kuta are congested due to tourists, making it difficult for locals to conduct their daily business
* Tourist facilities potentially deprive locals of their water supply as the tourism industry consumers much water and may result in water shortages
* Some dug wells have now gone dry, making vulnerable the island's poorest
* Locals expect tourists to respect local customs and values, which tourists sometimes fail to do
* Many locals still object to public displays of affection, which some tourists may perceive as all right to do in public

### Tourists and the environment

* Arise when the needs of tourist conflict with the need to conserve the environment
* Natural attractions depend on tourist income income for their conservations but tourist inflow may damage the attraction itself
* Machu Picchu, Peru is a city built by Inca Civilizations on the Andes mountain, 2430m above sea level
* It has stonewalls, ramps, pillars and stairways that are now remnants of a once-thriving city, providing insight into ancient inca life
* The rich history and breathtaking landscape draw 3,3000 visitors every day
* The site's popularity has cause some tensions between the needs of tourists and that of the environment
* Physically able tourists opt to use the inca trail with stunning mountain scenery, cloud forests,  rivers and inca ruins, and it is populated with rare indigenous plant and wildlife
* But, it has been eroded by more than 75,000 tourists that hike on it each year, and hikers leave behind rubbish like water bottles and plastic wrappers
* Tourists may prefer to reach the site using helicopters for convenience, but they were banned for the fear that its noise disturbs the area's indigenous anima and plant species
* The sheer  weight and combined footsteps of tourists damage land and artifacts on the site

### Measures for managing the tensions

* Government authorities play an important role in balancing and resolving tensions
* Organisation set up by governments may impose measures to balance the needs of tourists, locals and the environment
  * Limit the number of visitors at a site to minimise congestion and degradation
  * Withhold permission to proceed with tourism-related projects that could harm the environment, including the landscape and the flora and fauna
  * Holding discussions with locals regarding their needs and concerns
  * Restricting tourists from some areas where only local can enter
* Balancing the needs of various groups can be very difficult
* The needs of locals for jobs may defeat attempts at conservation
* Locals may be happy about limiting the number of visitors to a site, business might complain about low pedestrian traffic

## Responsibilities of various groups

### Local communities

* Local community is a group of people living in the same territory
* Local communities can play a role in conserving and protecting tourist areas, and benefit economically
* Community-based tourism is tourism that has close contact with and mainly benefits local communities
* Done in partnership with the government or an NGO
* In Candirejo Village, Indonesia, villagers set up a cooperative in 2003, with support from the government, to manage and implement community tourism-related programmes
* Villagers participate in decision-making through discussions and consultations with cooperative about programmes such as organising local transport, developing homestay accommodations and organic farms
* Villagers are trained to produce handicrafts, provide catering and work as tour guides
* 2012: 10 homestays, 5 andogs, no restaurants -> 2004: 22 homestays 22 andongs, 6 restaurants
* 63 new jobs, 5 new businesses and a 12.5% increase in income per villager
