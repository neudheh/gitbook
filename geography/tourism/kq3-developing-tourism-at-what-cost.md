# KQ3: Developing tourism at what cost?

## Economic impacts

### Employment opportunities

* Employment is work performed for a wage or a salary, in cash in kind
* The growth of tourism has led to an increase in the number of tourism related jobs&#x20;
* The tourism industry offers many employment opportunities (workers in hotels, transportation, souvenir shops and tour agencies)
* These jobs cater to the needs of tourists
* Jobs can also be indirectly linked to the tourism industry whenever tourists travel and consume goods (eg taxi drivers and shop owners)
* Example: In 2011, the UNWTO estimated that the tourism industry employed 255 million people worldwide, which is roughly 6 to 8% of all the jobs in the world

### Growth in income

* Growth in tourism can lead to growth in income for individuals and for a country
* Example: Fishermen on Pamilacan Island in the Philippines are hired by local tour companies to take domestic and international tourists on their boats to look for and swim with whale sharks and dolphins
  * They are paid between US$ 80-100 per boat for their services, which is a significant amount for the average filipino fisherman
* With a high demand for their service from tourists, the fishermen can expect additional income on top of their fishing livelihood
* Tour companies will also experience and increase in revenue
* Overall increase in revenue for the country through taxes collected from fishermen and tour companies
* However, a large portion of the tourism receipts is lost as leakage, especially in LDCs
* Occurs when revenue earned from tourism is paid to other countries for the import of goods and services needed to meet the needs of tourists

### Developments in infrastructure and facilities

* Infrastructure development is the construction of transport and communication networks, electrical frameworks and systems for water and waste disposal
* Without sufficient infrastructure and appropriate facilities, tourism cannot develop and would not be able to operate on a large scale → Introduction of tourism gives a government a good incentive to develop these things, which allow its own citizens to benefit
* Roads that link airports, cities and tourist sites allow tourists access to local attractions, and allow people better access to more markets, healthcare, education and jobs
* Example: In Beijing, China, underground railway systems were expanded to move large numbers of visitors during the Summer Olympic games in 2008. The rail systems continue to serve local populations and tourists even after the games

### Seasonal unemployment

* Certain tourist activities depend on climatic conditions → Countries may experience a rise in tourism number for several months, followed by a drop of tourist numbers for the next few months →People in tourism-related jobs may have to find other sources of income when employment in the tourism industry is temporarily unavailable
* Example: In many European countries surrounding the Mediterranean, most of the hotel stays are in the summer season of July to September mainly due to the warm weather that allows tourists to do a range of activities such as relaxing by the beach or hiking
  * Include Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy and Spain
  * Employment in hotels and restaurants across the European Union reaches its peak for the year

### Under-used of facilities at different times of the year

* Since some types of tourism are seasonal, facilities built specifically for certain events may be under-used when the event is over
* Income from tourists normally pays for the cost of managing these facilities → become neglected when the number of tourists drop drastically
* Example: Some of the venues in Beijing, China for the 2008 Summer Olympic games were reported to be deteriorating a few years after the Olympics
  * Some facilities had to be renovated to become more profitable
  * Beijing National Aquatics Centre had to be renovated into a water pa

### Shortage of services

* Tourist infrastructure may require the use of large amounts of land, water and power, and could lead to a shortage of services such as water supplies or power in non-tourist areas
* Example: Large amounts of water are required to water the grass on golf courses and fill swimming pools → Drinking water for nearby residents could be diverted to meet the needs of tourist infrastructure

## Socio-cultural impacts

#### Preservation of local cultures and heritage

* Preservation of custom and heritage is the protection of the way people live, including their economic activities, traditional beliefs and religious practices
* When preserved and restored, historical and cultural sites make a place more attractive to tourists, and benefit the local population by enhancing their sense of history and building a sense of belonging to their community
* Example: Christ Church in Malacca, Malaysia has been carefully restored and now stands as a relic of Malacca's colonial history, while serving as a tourist attraction
* Revenue generated from tourism can also fund the preservation and restoration of local cultural heritage&#x20;

#### Dilution of local cultures and heritage

* Commercial activities that cater mainly to tourists, such as food outlets, travel agencies, souvenir shops and hotels can become the major commercial activities of an area
* Older building may be converted to host tourist activities, and new and larger one may be constructed for tourism
* These activities may force the locals to relocate their original activities to other places, and the identity of the place may be lost, resulting in the original atmosphere, appearance and functions of an area to change
* To meet the demands and expectations of tourists, local cultural festivals and religious rituals are sometimes modified to fit the itinerary of tourists, deliberate poses for tourists to take photos, and repeated several times a day for different groups of tourists
* Authenticity and significance of these cultural events may be reduced when they become commercialized
* Example: In Thailand, tourists have to pay a hefty fee to enter the village of the Kayan Lahwi women, and due to the fee, some tourist treat the women as exhibits they have paid for, and aggressively take photos of the women without permission

#### Increased crime

* High crime levels may occur at popular tourist sites as some tourists carry valuable items such as watches, cameras and clothes, and may be vulnerable to muggings near hotels, transport terminals, ATMs and tourist attractions
* Tourists are also prone to being cheated or scammed in many tourist areas, and places where these are common are sometimes called tourist traps
* Tourist traps refer to places where information, goods and services are sold at greatly inflated prices, or places where tourist scams are common → deter tourists from visiting
* Example: In London, UK, Japanese tourists were approached by a woman pretending to be a tourist, and ask for directions or have photos taken. Her accomplice would then appear and pose as police officers to request for the groups’ identification and credit card. The woman would do so, and ask the tourists to do the same. They were used to withdraw money from the ATM or buy expensive items

## Environmental impacts

### Conservation of natural environments

* Tourism provides funding to help conserve environments such as coral reefs, rainforest and mountainous areas
* Revenue form entrance fees to national parks and diving sites, or even levies on nearby accommodations can be used to protect and conserve these environments
* Example: Sepilok Orang-utan Rehabilitation Centre in Sabah, Malaysian partly relies on visitor entrance fees to pay its staff that help rehabilitate orang-utans that have been orphaned or injured

### Vandalism

* Vandalism is the crime of deliberately damaging property belonging to other people
* Cultural, historical or natural sites may be vandalised by individuals or developers
* Example: Thousands of stones and bricks of the Great Wall of China, which is visited by 10 million tourists a year, are covered with graffiti

### Littering and pollution

* Excessive litter from tourists can become a major problem in tourist areas as authorities sometime fail to implement measures that would properly manage waste left behind by tourists → degradation of such areas
* Example; Irresponsible tourists aboard cruise ship often dump plastic bottles and old batteries overboard on the ships, causing harbors, marinas and the oceans to be polluted
  * Many island in the Caribbean have limited spaces on land to treat waste from ships, and as a result, solid and liquid waste are sometimes dumped into the Caribbean sea by ships, causing pollution

### Destruction of habitats

* Popular tourist sites such as quiet stretches of sandy beaches and scenic villages can be overwhelmed with visitors during busy times of the year
* When too many tourists visit a destination, they may destroy habitats and wildlife
  * Carless tourists may trample on plants
  * Others may collect eggs and feathers of birds as souvenirs
  * May make too much noise which can disturb and frighten off animals
* Example: Egypt’s Red Sea coast has developed into a major diving and snorkeling destination for around 1.2 million visitors annually, and unfortunately, the habitats of coral reefs and exotic fish have been damaged by some swimmers collecting shells or corals as souvenirs, and by hotels and restaurants in the area dumping wastes and sewage into the sea&#x20;

### Carbon footprint

* Carbon footprint refers to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that would be produced by activities that involves the use of fossil fuels
* These activities include travelling by planes and tour busses, and electricity consumption by hotels
* Example: The carbon footprint of a one-way economy flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur is 30 kilograms of carbon dioxide per passenger

### Increased congestion

* Larger numbers of tourist can cause overcrowding in areas close to tourist attractions, and tourist shops and accommodations may cluster near such areas due to the crowd and make them even more congested
* Often causes vehicle and pedestrian traffic to become congested as well
* The huge inflow of cars and buses can contribute to air pollution
* Example: In Rome, Italy, many older walkways and narrow streets are filled with tourists

## Management of impacts of tourism

* Management refers to making decisions that benefit both the natural environments visited by tourists and the lives of the local population
* Tourist activities should occur in an area without excessive use of its resources and damage to the environment or negative impacts to the surrounding society and culture
* Address the needs of visitors, industry and host communities

### Conserving fragile environments and promoting sustainable tourism

* Sustainable tourism: Form of tourism organized in a way that allows it to continue without causing damage to the environment or without leaving negative impacts on the surrounding society and culture
* Conservation is the careful management and use of resources such that these resources would not deplete.
* Conservation in important for fragile environments
  * E.g mangroves and coral reefs can be easily disturbed by the dumping of wastes from tourists facilities, removal of vegetation to build roads and buildings, and the disposal of waste into lakes, rivers or coastal environments

#### Laws and regulations



* Example: The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the world’s longest complex of coral reefs and small islands, stretching 2,300 kilometers along the northern eastern coast of Australia
  * Receives 14 million tourists every year, and is threatened by tourism activities such as fuel leaks from pleasure boats, particularly in marinas and harbors
  * Also threatened by the removal of corals for souvenirs
  * Its diverse ecosystem and beauty gave the reef its place on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 1981, protecting it by laws and regulations
  * UNESCO is very much involved in the conservation and protection of cultural and natural heritage around the world, providing funding for conservation activities as well as assistance to sites in immediate danger, and the number of World Heritage has increased form 12 in 1978 to almost a 1000 by 2012
* A well protected environment attracts more tourists visit it and previous tourists to return → repeated, steady arrivals of tourists will benefit the locals economically → Income from tourism  motivates locals to care properly for the sites that tourists visit, enduring a regular, viable stream of income from tourism in the future

### Engaging local communities

* Sustainable tourism also involved minimising leakages from tourism revenues through the support from local people
* Different strategies are adopted to reduce leakages
  * Training locals to perform skilled tourism jobs, e.g management, marketing
  * Developing homestay accommodations where visitors can pay local people directly for their accommodation
  * Promoting local food and drink in restaurant to provide a market for local food producers and distributors
* They can benefit economically from tourism, especially community based tourism, which is tourism that has close contact with, and mainly benefits local communities
* Done in partnership with an NGO
* Example: Candirejo Village, Indonesia
  * Set up a cooperative in 2003 with the support of the government to manage and implement the community’s tourism-related programmes
  * Villagers participated in decision making through discussions and consultations with the cooperative about details of the programmes to be carried out
  * Included developing homestay accommodations, training villagers to develop handicrafts, provide catering and to work as tour guides
  * By 2004, the village had 22 homestays, 22 andongs (local transports of horse drawn carts) and 6 local restaurants for only 10 homestays, 5 andonds and no restaurants in 2002
  * 63 new jobs, 5 new businesses as well as an average increase of income per villager by 12.5 %

## Tensions

### Tourists and the environment

* Arise when the needs of tourists conflict with the need to conserve the environment
* Natural attractions depend on tourist income for their conservation, but tourist inflow may damage the attraction itself
* Example: Machu Picchu, Peru is a city built by the Inca civilization on the Andes Mountains, located 2430 metres above sea level. It has stone walls, ramps and pillars that are now remnants of a once thriving city which provides insight into ancient Inca life
  * Its rich history and breath-takign landscape draw 3,300 visitors everyday
  * The popularity has caused some tensions between the needs of tourists and that of the environment
  * Physically able tourist opt to use the ‘Inca trail’ for its stunning mountain scenery, cloud forests, rivers, inca ruins and it is densely populated with rare indeginous plant and wildlife
  * However, it was eroded by more more than 75,00 tourists that hike on it each year
  * Hikers leave behind rubbish e.g water bottles, plastic wrappers
  * Tourist may prefer to reach the site using helicopters for convenience → ban on helicopter for fear that the noise disturbs the area’s indeginous animal and plant species
  * Sheer weight and combine footsteps of tourists damage land and artefacts on the site

### Locals and tourists

* The needs of tourists may conflict with the needs of locals, e.g Tourists wearing skimpy clothing may go against conservative values of locals
* Example: Bali, Indonesia, visited by many tourists for natural landscape and food, and has a cultural landscape  renowned for its hindu temples, art and dance and other heritage and customs
  * In 2012, 2.9 million international tourists visited Bali
  * Tourist sites (e.g Kuta) congested due to tourists → made it difficult for locals to conduct their daily business
  * Tourist facilities (hotels, convention centres, etc) potential deprive some locals of their water supply, as the tourism industry consumes 65% if the islands water supply, resulting in water shortages → Some dug wells have now gone dry, making the island’s poorest the most vulnerable
  * Locals expect tourist to respect local customs and values, which tourists sometimes fail to do, e.g many locals still object to public displays of affection, which some tourists may perceive as all right to do in public

### Measures for managing the tensions

* Government authorities play an important role in balancing and resolving tension
* Governments set up organisations to impose measure to balance the needs of tourists, locals and the environment
  * Limit the number of visitors to minimise congestion and degradation
  * Withhold permission to proceed with tourism related project that could harm the environment, including the landscape and the flora and fauna
  * Employing staff to maintain and repair sites and prevent tourists from tampering with it
  * Hold discussions with locals on their needs and concerns
  * Restrict tourist from areas where only locals could enter
* Balancing the neews of various groups may be difficult
  * Resident may be happy about limiting the number of visitors to the site, but business owners might complain of a low pedestrian traffic
  * Needs of locals for jobs may defeat attempts of conservation
* Various groups and stakeholders have a responsibility to ensure balance between conflicting interests
*

## Responsibilites of various groups

### Local communities

* A local community refers to a group of people living in the same territory
* They have a key role in conserving and protecting tourist areas
* They can benefit economically from tourism, especially community based tourism, which is tourism that has close contact with, and mainly benefits local communities
* Done in partnership with an NGO
* Example: Candirejo Village, Indonesia
  * Set up a cooperative in 2003 with the support of the government to manage and implement the community’s tourism-related programmes
  * Villagers participated in decision making through discussions and consultations with the cooperative about details of the programmes to be carried out
  * Included developing homestay accommodations, training villagers to develop handicrafts, provide catering and to work as tour guides
  * By 2004, the village had 22 homestays, 22 andongs (local transports of horse drawn carts) and 6 local restaurants from only 10 homestays, 5 andongs and no restaurants in 2002

| Involve locals in decision-making                                | Difficulty in obtaining external funding |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Increase in tourism related employment and businesses for locals | Shortage of skilled labour               |

### Visitors

* Visitors or tourists have a responsibility to respect both the environment and the local population of the place they are visiting
* They should visit without causing damage or offence
* Example: The Tourism sustainability group set up by the European commission encourages tourism to select their holiday destinations based on the conservation efforts of the place, and its carbon footprint
  * Consider factors like amount of water used, amount of waste recycled
  * Visits become more rewarding with the knowledge that they have done their best to avoid damaging these environments

| Fund conservation and preservation                   | Damage tourist attractions            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Provide income opportunities for locals              | Dilution of local culture and customs |
| Raise awareness to conserve and preserve attractions | <p><br></p>                           |

### Tour operators

* Tour operators may belong to associations that are increasingly concerned with conserving and protecting environments visited by tourists&#x20;
* Fewer tourists may visit a place if the unspoilt landscapes, rich biodiversity and unique cultures deteriorate
* Example: Phuket alternative Tours (PAT) was set up by a team of tour operators in 2006
  * Tour operators who want to operate under the PAT  have to operate under environmental and cultural code of practice
    * Operate in an environmentally sustainable way
    * Seek to enhance the natural environment and the way the industry uses it
    * Create awareness about environmental conservation for visitors to Phuket



| Provide feedback on tourist attractions | Need to generate profits |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Regulate tourist behavior               | <p><br></p>              |

### Non-Governmental organizations (NGOs)

* Are Non-profit organizations operating independently of governments
* A number of NGOs are concerned with tourism’s impact on natural and human environments
* Example: The International Ecotourism Society
  * Developed guidelines on tourism
    * Conducted training courses
    * Provided technical assistance
    * Published research paper related to tourism and the environment
    * Works with numerous organizations, including travel associations and conservation groups in 124 countries

| Facilitate communication between various stakeholders           | Difficulty in obtaining external funding |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Support various stakeholders in managing the impacts of tourism | <p><br></p>                              |

### Planning authorities

* Most important group in ensuring that the tourist areas are protected
* Can greatly influence the future quality of environments by
  * Determining how many visitors a site can cope with
  * Allocating space for infrastructure, e.g roads and hotels
* Should consider local local sensitivities in the area, while maintaining its physical and socio-cultural condition
* Enforce rules, regulations, values and principle for sustainable tourism in consultation with the industry and community
* Example: Singapore tourism board
  * Attracts large numbers of tourist into Singapore even as development plans take into account the need to conserve national heritage
  * Implemented programs to conserve the ethnic districts of Singapore e.g Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little india
  * Helped visitors and locals have a greater appreciation of Singapore's rich heritage

| Develop and maintain infrastructure and attractions | Difficult to plan for unforeseen factors |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Draft laws and policies                             | Opposing stakeholders                    |
