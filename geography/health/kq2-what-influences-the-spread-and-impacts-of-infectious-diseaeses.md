# KQ2: What influences the spread and impacts of infectious diseaeses?

## Scale at which diseases occur

* **An epidemic occurs when an infectious disease affects a population at higher than normal rates**
* The Incident rate (number of new cases in a particular population over a specified time period) is greater than expected
* The prevalence rate is the total number of existing cases of a disease in a particular population
* **Pandemic is a widespread epidemic, usually continent-wide or global in reach**
* **An endemic is a disease that is constantly present at low levels in a particular population or region**

## Malaria

* Malaria is a life threatening disease cause by a parasite
* Female mosquitoes of the anopheles specimen transmit malaria
* Mode of transmission of human-mosquito-human (transmitted from person to person via mosquitos)
* Spread through expansion diffusion (spread outwards from its source) instead of relocation diffusion (introduction of a disease to its region of of its geographic range)
* Most widespread in the tropical and subtropical zones
* Endemic
* The African mosquito species have a relatively long lifespan. and tend to bite humans over animals, causing a high incidence of malaria and higher death rates from malaria
* When Indonesia was hit by a tsunami in 2004, pools of stagnant water left behind by the tsunami and heavy rains provided mosquitos with suitable breeding conditions, causing survivors of the tsunami to be more vulnerable to malaria
* Malaria infections can also occur in non-endemic regions by visiting regions where malaria is endemic
* Children are more vulnerable since they have lower immunity against diseases
* Pregnant women and people with HIV/AIDS are also more vulnerable due to weakened immunity

## Factors contributing to the spread of malaria

### Lack of proper sanitation

* Waste water is not disposed of properly, causing pools of stagnant water to form
* These pools are replenished when it rains, and provide a favorable breeding ground for mosquitos
* When located close to settlements, it increases the risk of people being infected with malaria

### Limited provision of and access of healthcare&#x20;

* Limited provision of and access in the healthcare may come in the form of&#x20;
  * Shortage of doctors - India has a critical shortage of doctors, with only 6 doctors for every 10,000 people
  * Lack of health services - most of India's healthcare spending is concentrated in urban areas, while little spending goes to rural areas
  * Cost of malaria treatment - Malaria medication can cost may times the monthly income of the people in areas where malaria is a serious problem, and those who cannot afford it resort to cheaper but ineffective treatment

### Overcrowded living conditions

* Overcrowded living situations are situations in which large numbers of people live very close together in a small area
* People share the same space and use the same items
* People interact with each other more often and more closely
* Diseases spread quickly and easily
* Housing for refugees and migrant workers are often overcrowded with many people sharing one room
  * Unhygienic conditions
  * Houses do not have proper doors and windows to keep out Anopheles mosquitos that are active at night
  * Mosquitos can go easily from person to person

### Poor drainage and stagnant water

* Poor drainage of water create condition favorable for growth of mosquito populations
* Mosquitos breed quicky without interruptions where there is low awareness of malaria and no precautions are taken to remove pools of stagnant water
* Water from 8000km of canals in the Great Indian Thar Desert leaked into many places and form breeding grounds for the Anopheles mosquitos&#x20;
  * There have been regular outbreaks of malarian in desert areas of western India since the 1980s
  * Similar environmental changes in other parts of India and Asia created new mosquito habitats that contributed to the spread of malaria

### Effect of climate

* Temperature, rainfall and relative humidity have a direct impact on mosquitos
* Monsoons create favorable conditions for mosquitos to breed in by bringing in large amounts of rainfall
* The post monsoon periods poses more risk for malaria to spread as pools of stagnant water are left behind as flooded areas dry up
* Consequently, epidemics of malaria take place
* Forested villages in Orissa, India where malaria incidence in the village is dependent on the intensity and duration of the monsoon rains, and on the timing of the start of winter
  * These factors contribute to infection peak periods during the post-monsoon moths form September to February

## Impacts of malaria

### Death rate

* Malaria has an impact on the population of countries, communities and households
* The number of people falling ill or dying varies from country to country
* Most of the deaths caused by malaria in 2010 were form LDCs (Democratic republic of Congo, Nigeria)

### Infant mortality rate

* The infant morality rate for children was very high in some places, e.g. out of every 1000 children alive in Nigeria, 140 die form malaria within their first year of birth
* Women who contract malaria during pregnancy may infect the unborn child, e.g. 75,000 to 200,000 infants die every year within their first year of birth due to malaria infection during pregnancy

### Burden of malaria on households

* The economic burden of malaria on individuals and households my include increased medical expenses
* Example: In the republic of Ghana, the economic burden can be as high as 34% of a household's income

### Cost of healthcare

* Countries affected by malaria would need to set aside funds for the provision of healthcare to address the disease
* Malaria can account for as much as 40% of public health spending in some countries
* Funds may be used for building maintenance, investments in hospitals and clinics, and the purchase of mediation and insecticide-treated nets

### Loss of productivity

* People infected with malaria might not be able to work due to their poor health, resulting in a loss of productivity
* Productivity is the rate at which goods or services are produced measured in output per unit of labor
* Lower productivity results in slower economic growth
* Areas endemic to malaria were found to experience a slowdown in economic growth

## HIV/ AIDS

* Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the cells of the immune system by destroying white blood cells that are critical to fighting infections
* Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the final stage of HIV, when the immune system is severely damaged, causing the body to become vulnerable to infections
* A person dies from complications resulting from other infections
* A person that is infected with HIV/AIDs is HIV-positive, and may not have symptoms at all for the next 9-10 years, during which they would develop aids
* There is currently no known cure for AIDS
* Transferred from person to person through blood or bodily fluids
* Sexual contact, sharing of infected needles, pregnant mothers to babies and blood transfusion
* Spreads through relocation and expansion diffusion
* The most explosive growth was during the mid 1990s, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where it spread mainly through expansion diffusion
* By 2003, Africa was home to 2/3 of people living with HIV/AIDS
* Continued to spread around the world
* Sub-Saharan Africa, central America and southeast Asia experience the highest incidence rate of HIV/AIDS
* People that partake in risk-taking behaviors, people who lack sexuality education awareness, children or infants born to HIV-positive mothers and women are most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS
* Women are more vulnerable to men as they are twice as likely to contract HIV/AIDS during heterosexual intercourse and women are subject to sex without their consent in some societies
* Millions of children are living with HIV/AIDS, with several thousand more being infected each year, most which are acquired from their mothers during pregnancy or breastfeeding

## Factors contributing to the spread of HIV/AIDS

### Social stigma

* Social stigma is extreme disapproval associated with a particular circumstance, or quality of a person
* Commonly associated with HIV/ AIDS
* HIV/ ADIS patients face various forms of discrimination
  * Refusal of access to healthcare facilities
  * Rejection by family or community
  * Expulsion from school
  * Denial from housing
* Prejudice and ignorance about HIV/AIDS hindered early intervention of the disease

### Education

* Some people may not be aware of how HIV/AIDS can be transmitted, possibly due to a lack of education
* These people may be more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS
* Cultural practices keep girls from knowing about sex and sexuality until marriage
* In Nigeria, discussion of sex is seen as inappropriate and is not conducted in schools as sex is a very private subject in the country
  * Sexuality awareness education is not conducted in schools in Nigeria

### Lifestyle choices

* Certain lifestyle choices may increase one's risk of being infected with HIV/AIDS
  * Drug injections
  * Sharing needles
  * Refusal to use condoms
* Drug abuse can put a persona t risk of being infected with HIV/AIDS
* Drug and alcohol intoxication can affect judgement and lead to undafe sexual practices

### Lapses in medical practices

* Mistakes, corruption and negligence associated with medical practices contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS
* 5-10% of HIV infections were transmitted by blood transfusions tainted with HIV/AIDS
* Often occurred in countries where there was no effective blood screening before blood was donated
* Blood tainted with HIV/AIDS might have been collected and used in blood transfusions
* From 2001-2011  in the USA, 130,000 patients were potentially exposed to HIV due to contaminated containers and syringes used during blood transfusion

### Vice trades

* Vice trades are business activities such as the involvement in illegal drugs or commercial sex work
* In China, some women, especially those who move from the villages have limited access to education and job training, resulting in limited job options
* These women may resort to commercial sex work due to the lack of viable options, making them vulnerable to HIV/AIDS

### Mobility

* Mobility refers to the movement of people form one place to another often for work reasons
* Also refers to people who move from one place to another in search of better job opportunities
* May be determined by the type of occupation a person has (miner, truck drivers)
* People who have left their families in search of work may feel socially excluded and get involved in risk-taking behaviors, putting themselves at risk of getting infected
* Development of modern transportation has helped the spread of HIV/AIDS
* The tourism industry contributes to the spread of HIV/AIDS
* Tourists often take risks they would not take at home like drink more and engage in unprotected sex
* In 2010, some tourists from Queensland, Australia, were infected with HIV when they travelled for a vacation to a country with high HIV/AIDS prevalence

## Impacts of HIV/AIDS

### Life expectancy and infant mortality rate

* HIV/AIDS increases a country's number of deaths and reduces its life expectancy, population size and population growth
* In countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, life expectancies are almost 6 years lower than what it would have been in the absence of the disease
* By 2025, the figure is expected to be at 10.8 years
* HIV/AIDS cause an increase in the countries infant mortality rate

### Orphan crisis

* Orphan crisis is situation win which large numbers of children lose their parents due to HIV/AIDS
* There are 17 million orphans due to HIV/AIDS. a large majority of whom live in Sub-Saharan African countries
* Many of the orphans are cared for by extended families
* Careers of the orphans are plagued by deeper poverty due to medical costs and living expenses incurred&#x20;
* Orphanages are built by NGOs to care for the orphans
* Some orphans do not have any support form adults, and suffer from emotional trauma from losing their parents
* They are vulnerable to force labor, being forced into the sex industry and recruitment as child soldiers
* They are often stigmatized by society through association with HIV/AIDS, and assumed to be HIV-positive themselves
* The loss of parents to HIV/AIDS can limit a child's access to basic necessities (shelter, food, clothes, health, education)
* Orphans are more likely to suffer from malnutrition and illnesses, as well as be infected with HIV/AIDS
* They are often faced with a lower standard of living

### Cost of health care

* Healthcare costs for HIV/AIDS are expensive for both individuals and countries
* High costs of treatment and research, and healthcare expenditures by governments
* The medications used to treat HIV/AIDS are called antiretroviral drugs
  * Do not cure HIV/AIDS but keep it from progressing in the body
  * Stops patients form suffering from complications for many years and even decades
  * But, they are expensive
  * In places where the drugs are subsidized or free, the cost is borne by NGOs or the government
* They have to be taken daily for the patient's entire life
* Pregnant mothers with HIV/AIDS are also subject to treatment
  * They have to go through screening prior to delivery
  * They receive antenatal treatment (prior to deliver) to reduce the risk of passing HIV/AIDS to their babies
* Governments may allocate limited resource to care for HIV/AIDS patients, diverting resources that could be used instead for other purposes
* In 2010, the government of South Africa spent Us$1.2 billion on healthcare expenditure for HIV/AIDS patients

### Loss of productivity resulting in lower economic growth

* HIV/AIDS slows down economic growth through
  * A shortage of skilled labor in the workforce through death or illnesses
  * Using funds that could be sued for education, leading to a lower skilled workforce that deters foreign investment as businesses cannot find enough people to employ
  * Using fund that could be sued for infrastructure, leading to an absence of infrastructure that could hinder the economic growth of a country
* Businesses are less likely to invest in places
  * without adequate infrastructure
  * No skilled labor force
  * with a population in poor health
* Uganda experienced slow economic growth due to HIV/AIDS, and economic growth slowed by 1.2% each year due to HIV/AIDS, and if the trend continues, the countries economic growth could be reduced by up to 39% by 2025 as a direct result of HIV/AIDS
