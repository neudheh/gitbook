# KQ1: What are the global patterns of health and diseases?

## Health indicators

* Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and it is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity
* The most commonly used indicators of health are the infant mortality rate and the life expectancy

### Infant mortality rate

* The infant mortality rate of a country is the number of infants that die before reaching one year old per 1000 live births in a year
* $$IMR = \frac{Number\char32of\char32infant\char32deaths}{Number\char32of\char32live\char32births}\times 1000$$
* The more developed a country is, the lower its IMR tens to beâ€‹
* DCs have a lower IMR than LDCs, because of good standards of living, which is particularly important for young children who are vulnerable to environmental conditions
* Given such living conditions, infants have access to good healthcare, clean drinking water, and a hygienic environment
* Most LDCs have a higher IMR ranging from 14-74 per 1000 live births
* But, this is not always the case, as some LDCs such as Argentina and Thailand has a lower IMR of below 14 per 1000 live births

### Life expectancy

* The life expectancy at birth is the average number of year from the time of birth a person can expect to live
* Life expectancy is also linked to levels of development; a Higher life expectancy of 80 years old and above is generally found in DCs such as Australia, France and Japan
* Life expectancy to 70-79 years is also found in other DCs such as the USA and Portugal
* A lower life expectancy of 60-69 Years is usually found in LDCs, due to the lack of nutritious food, proper hygiene and sanitation
* LDCs such as Afghanistan, Chad and Zambia have even lower life expectancy of below 50 years

## Social factors

### Diet

* Diet refers to the food and drink that people consume
* Poor diets can result in malnutrition, which is a condition in which the body does not get the sufficient or balanced amount of nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ functions
* Caused by an unbalanced diet or insufficient food
* Obesity is a medical condition in which there is excessive fat accumulation in the body that can impair one's health

### Lifestyle choices

* Lifestyle choices refer to how a person chooses to live and behave, according to attitudes, habits and values
* It is important to make healthy lifestyle choices to reduce the burden of diseases and maintain a high quality of life
* A healthy lifestyle reduces the risk of many diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and depression
* This lifestyle include physical activity such as sufficient exercise, and daily activities such as walking and doing housework
* Physical inactivity was responsible for 6% of global deaths; deaths resulting from physical inactivity was more significant in DCS, but the wealthy in LDCs are also vulnerable
* Hired help in the household and the use of technology often result in decreasing physical activity
* Smoking is a bigger problem in LDCs than in DCs, as 80% of the world's one billion smokers are from LDCs
* Healthy lifestyle choices
  * Balanced diet - Stronger immune system, increased energy, healthier heat and better overall health
  * Physical activity - Better weight control, stronger resistance against certain diseases and improved sleep
* Unhealthy lifestyle choices
  * Smoking - Cardiovascular diseases, Various cancers such as lung, stomach and mouth cancer
  * Excessive drinking - Chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure and liver failure

### Education

* Education refers to the process of teaching and learning, often within the context of formal institutions such as a school or university
* People who are educated are more likely to be informed on how to lead a healthy lifestyle, earn higher incomes which give them greater access to quality medical treatment, food and living conditions
* When women are more informed of nutrition and healthcare, the IMR tends to be lower
* Mothers who are healthy are also able to care and provide for their children more effectively
* Children who receive formal schooling are likely to learn about healthcare and nutrition, and are more likely to make informed choices about diet and lifestyle
* DCs tend to have fewer children who are out of school as compared to LDCs, and children are more likely to stay in school and complete their education
* Education is compulsory in DCs, and DCs often have more resources to invest in education than LDCs
* There are also more people living in poverty in LDCs, making them more likely to drop out because it is not affordable for their family, or to start working from a young age to supplement their household income

## Economic factors

### Poverty and affluence

* Poverty is a state of not having enough money and material resources such as food, water, clothing&#x20;
* Limits the purchasing power that people have to afford basic healthcare
* People are also more likely to be exposed to health risks because of poor quality housing and insufficient nutrition
* People living on lesser than US$1.90 a day are referred to as living in extreme poverty
* 12.7% of the world's population remains below the extreme poverty line
* Low socio-economic status brought about by poor education, lack of amenities, unemployment or job security contribute to poor health
* Children are the most vulnerable to health problems due to poverty
* They are more prone to nutrition related diseases such as kwashiorkor
* They have lesser access to vaccination, which the administration that stimulates an individual's immune system to develop resistance against a particular disease
* Affluence is having an abundant supply of money, property and other material goods
* Affluence provides people with greater access to food and better quality health services, increasing their resistance to disease and enabling them to deal with diseases
* They can choose to adopt healthy and nutritious dies, and consult well-trained healthcare professionals
* But they are also more likely to consume high amounts of meant and other non-staple food which may lead to other health problems

### Investment in healthcare and access to health services

* Investment in healthcare refers to resources devoted by government, businesses or individuals for the purposes of addressing  the mental and medical needs of a population
* Health services refer to organisation and facilities whose main aim is to maintain and improve health
* Access to health services to people's ability to obtain the services of these organisations and facilities
* Governments can invest in healthcare by building and maintaining hospitals, including the money used to train and hire staff, such as doctors and nurses
  * They also include the money used to purchase medicine and metal equipment, such as syringes and X-ray machines
  * It can also come from the private sector, such as pharmaceutical companies that invest money on new drugs, and companies that invest money to establish a private hospital
* The amount and quality of health services people can obtain depend on its accessibility, availability and affordability
  * Health services are accessible when they are easily reached by people who need them
  * In LDCs, it may not be as easy to get proper health services in DCs, as people in rural areas have to travel long distances to get to the nearest hospitals in major cities
  * The availability of health services depends on whether there is sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the people
  * Doctor-patient ratios is the ratio of the number of doctors to a given population
  * Bed-patient ratio is the ratio of the number of hospital beds oto a given population
  * Countries with a good level of healthcare often have high doctor-patient and bed-patient ratio
  * Countries with a poor level of healthcare often have low doctor-patient and bed-patient ratios
  * Cost and affordability affect people's ability to obtain health services
  * Many LDCs do not have adequate healthcare infrastructure due to a lack of sufficient resources or inappropriate use of existing funds
  * The burden of healthcare cost is transferred to patients, who may not be ablet to afford the cost of receiving medical treatment
* DCs often have greater investments in healthcare than LDCs due to greater resources of their governments and private sector, and thus are more likely to have better access to healthcare than LDCs

## Environmental factors

### Living conditions

* Living conditions refer to a set of characteristics that include housing, living spaces and access to basic services such as water, electricity and sanitation
* Good living conditions include
  * Durable housing of a permanent nature that protects against extreme weather conditions
  * Sufficient living space which means no more than 3 people sharing one room
  * Access to adequate sanitation in the form of a public or private share by a reasonable amount of people
* Communities or populations that lack one or more of the above are said to have poor living conditions
* Slums is an example of poor living conditions, and are characterized by poorly secured structures, poor ventilation and overcrowding
* Living in slums often results in poor health and contributes to the incidence of diseases
* In areas with good living conditions, dwellings are solid structures built to keep animals and insects out, which can carry diseases,
* They are supplied with clean water, electricity and sanitation, which help to keep the houses clean and reduce the incidence of diseases

### Access to safe drinking water

* Drinking water is water that is used for domestic purposes, such as drinking, cooking and personal hygiene
* Safe drinking water may be obtained for water sources such as a water service pipe, public standpipes and protected dug wells
* Access to safe drinking water means the water source is 1km away from tis place of use and it is possible to obtain reliable at least 20 litres for every member of a household per day
* The lack of access to safe drinking water can cause the spread of water diseases such as cholera and even lead poisoning
* Water that has not stored properly if their containers are not properly covered or regularly cleaned
* This can encourage harmful microorganisms to grow, and provide a breeding spot for mosquitoes
* This can cause people to fall sick
* 89% of the world's population now has access to safe drinking water as of 2010
* 99% of people living in DCs and 86% if people in LDCs have access to clean drinking water
* Providing safe drinking water for a large population requires time and large investments due to the high cost of constructing water supply infrastructure such as pipe and water treatment facilities

### Proper sanitation

* Sanitation refers to the safe storage, treatment and disposal of waste
* Includes having toilets, urinals, sewage pipes, treatment plants, and facilities that help manage reuse or recycle trash, such as rubbish bins, garbage trucks and landfills
* Human waste contains harmful microorganisms that can cause diseases
* Sanitation facilities control and manage these wastes to prevent the population from being exposed to the harmful microorganisms
* They also help keep the population of pests, such as rats and cockroaches under control by minimizing the amount of waste for them to live on
* Poor sanitation may result from the dumping or leaking of sewage into water bodies,like resivoris, rivers and lakes, polluting them and leading to the spread of waterborne diseases
* in 1990, only 49% of the world had access to proper sanitation, but by 2010 this had increased to 63%
* But, as of 2015, there are still 2.4 billion people who do not have access to proper sanitation
* The lack of access to proper sanitation is a problem for both DCs and LDCs, but is a greater problem in LDCs
