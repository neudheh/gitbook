# KQ1: What are the global patterns of health and diseases?

* Health is a state of complete physical, metal and social well-being. It is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity

## Indicators used to measure health

### Infant mortality rate

* The infant mortality rate (IMR) of a country is the number of infants that die before reaching one year old per 1,000 live births in a year
* Developed countries (DCs) have lower IMR than Less Developed Countries (LDCs)&#x20;
* IMR is low in DCs due to good standards of living as young children who are vulnerable to environmental conditions have access to good health care, clean drinking water and a hygienic environment
* Most LDCs have a higher IMR ranging from 14 to 74 per 1000 live births
* The more developed a country is, the lower its IMR tends to be, but this is not always the case

### Life expectancy

* Life expectancy is the average number of years from the time of birth a person can expect to live
* High life expectancy of 80 years and above is generally found in DCs
* Lower life expectancy of 60-69 years is usually found in LDCs due to the lack of nutritious food, proper hygiene and sanitation

## Social factors

### Diet

* Diet refers to the food and drink that people consume
* **Malnutrition is a condition in which the body does not get the sufficient of balance amount of nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ functions**
* Malnutrition was the underlying cause of childe deaths associated with diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria and measles in 2009
* 52.5% of all deaths in children under 5 years of age was caused by malnutrition
* **Obesity is a medical condition in which there is excessive fat accumulation in the body that can impair one's health**
* Obesity affects most of the body's systems and can lead to health problems such as high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers

### **Lifestyle choices**

* Lifestyle choices refer to how a person chooses to live and behave, according to attitudes and values
* It is important to make healthy lifestyle choices to reduce the burden of diseases and maintain a high quality of life
* A healthy lifestyle reduces the risk of many diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and depression
* Physical inactivity was responsible for 6% of all global deaths
* Physical inactivity was more significant in DCs, but the wealthy in LDCs are affected too as hired help in the household and the use of technology often result in decreasing physical activity
* Smoking is a bigger problem in LDCs than in DCs, as 80% of smokers are from LDCs
* Balanced diet -> stronger immune system, increased energy, healthier heart and better overall health
* Physical activity -> Better weight control, stronger resistance against certain diseases, and improved sleep
* Smoking -> cardiovascular diseases and various cancers such as long, stomach and mouth cancer
* Excessive drinking -> chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure and liver failure

### Education

* Education refers to the process of teaching and learning, often within the context of formal institutions
* Allows people to be more informed on how to live healthier lifestyles, and earn higher incomes that give them access to greater quality medical treatment, food and living conditions
* Mothers who are healthy are able to care and provide for their children more effectively
* DCs tend to have fewer children who are out of school than LDCs
* Education is compulsory in DCs and DCs have more resources to invest in education
* More people live in poverty in LDCs, and children who live in poverty are more likely to drop out

## Economic factors

### Poverty and affluence

* Poverty is the state of not having enough money and material resources
* Limits the purchasing power that people have to afford basic health care -> more likely to be exposed to health risks because of poor quality housing and insufficient nutrition
* People living on US$1.90 or less a day are referred to be living in extreme poverty
* 12.7% of the world's population remains below the extreme poverty line
* Low socio-economic states brought about by poor education, lack of amenities, unemployment and job insecurity contribute to poor health
* Children are the most vulnerable to health problems due to poverty
* More vulnerable to nutrition-related diseases such as kwashiorkor
* They have less access to vaccination, which is the administration of a treatment that stimulates an individuals immune system to develop resistance to a particular disease

### Investment in healthcare and access to health services

* Investment in healthcare refers to the resources devoted by government, businesses or individuals for the purposes of addressing the health and medical needs of a population
* Building and maintaining hospitals, training and hiring staff, purchasing medicine and medical equipment are investments&#x20;
* Health services refer to organizations and facilities whose main aim is to maintain and improve health
* Access to health services refers to people's ability to obtain the services of these organizations and facilities
* More accessible when they are easily reached by people who need them
* The availability of health services depends on wither there is sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the people
* The doctor-patient ratio refers to the number of doctors to a given population
* Bed-patient ratio refers to the ratio of the number of hospital beds to a given population
* Countries with a good level of health will often will have high bed-patient and doctor-patient ratios and vice-versa
* DCs often have greater investment in healthcare due to greater resources of their governments and private sectors, and are also more likely to have better access to health care

## Environmental factors

### Living conditions

* Living conditions refer to a set of characteristics that include housing, living spaces and access to basic services
* Good living conditions include
  * Durable housing of a permanent nature that protects against extreme weather conditions
  * Sufficient living space (no more than 3 people sharing the same room)
  * Easy access to safe water in sufficient amounts at an affordable price
  * Access to adequate snatiation in the form of a public/private toilet shared by a reasonable number of people
* Communities that lack one or more of the above are said to be in poor living conditions
* In areas with good living conditions, dwellings are solid structures built to keep animals and insects out, with clean water, electricity and sanitation

### Access to safe drinking water

* Drinking water is defined as water that is used for domestic purposes, such as drinking cooking and personal hygiene
* Safe drinking water may be obtained from water service pipes, public standpipes and protected dug wells
* The water source is less then 1km away from its place of use and it is possible to obtain 20 liters for every member of a household everyday
* The lack of access to safe drinking water can lead to waterborne diseases such as cholera and lead poisoning
* 89% of the world now has access to safe drinking water
* DCs have higher access to drinking water as it requires time and large investments

### Proper sanitation

* Sanitation refers to the safe storage, treatment and disposal of waste
* Includes having functioning toilets, urinals, sewage pipes and treatment plants
* Human waste may contain harmful microorganisms that can cause diseases
* Sanitation facilities control and manage these wastes to prevent the population form being exposed to the harmful microorganisms
* Poor sanitation may result from the dumping or leakage of waste which could lead to waterborne diseases
* Greater problem in LDCs
