# KQ3: How can we manage the current and future spread of infectious diseases?

## Emerging and reemerging diseases

* One challenge in managing infectious diseases is the occurrence of emerging and re-emerging diseases
* Emerging infectious diseases are diseases that appear in a population for the first time
* Re-emerging infectious disease are diseases that may have existed in a population or region previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence and geographic range
* They may also occur in a different form or location

## Reemergence of malaria

### Resistance to antimalarial drugs

* Resistance to antimalarial drugs have increased due to the rise in the use of counterfeit or incomplete doses of antimalarial drugs
* This allows the surviving malaria parasites to build resistance to the drug, since it did not kill all the parasites
* Migrant workers from India has surviving malaria parasites that were resistant to antimalarial drugs in their bodies while working in Thailand
* When they returned to India, the brought the surviving parasites with them
* The existing malaria treatment in INdia became ineffective against the surviving parasites, making it more difficult to contain the spread of malaria in India

### Air travel

* Due to the increase in air travel, disease-causing organisms can also be transported to new areas, leading to the reemergence of malaria in places such as France
* A passenger may board a plane in Asia, and an anopheles mosquito infected by malaria enters the plane and bites the passenger
* After leaving the plane in europe, the passenger is bitten by another anopheles mosquito, which acquires the malaria parasite and spreads the disease when it takes blood from another person

### Climate change

* When the climate gets warmer, temperatures at higher altitudes increase
* These places become favourable breeding sites for mosquitoes due to the increased temperatures
* Climate change has raised average temperature in the Central highlands region of Kenya, allowing malaria to occur in areas of higher altitude, resulting in an additional 4 million people at risk of malaria

### Insecticide-resistant mosquitoes

* The use of chemical pesticide DDT was replaced by chemical such as pyrethroids
* But, pyrethroids were ineffective against mosquitoes, which were able to build resistance to the chemical over time
* Mosquito resistance to insecticides has been detected in 64 countries around the world

## Challenges in managing the spread of malaria

### Socio-economic challenges

#### Limitations of healthcare

* A challenge in controlling malaria lies in healthcare
* Malaria parasites can develop resistance to antimalarial drugs due to the incomplete treatments of an infected person, causing the surviving parasites to develop resistance to the drug
* In 2009, resistance to antimalarial drugs was observed along the Thai-Cambodian border

#### Population movement due to efficient transport and communications

* Population movement is the movement of people across borders
* The movement of people spreads and transmit diseases to new locations
* Malaria control programmes become ineffective because it is difficult to monitor the movement of people
* The volume and speed of movement is increasing and occuring at a larger scale than before&#x20;
* This is due to the ease of travelling with better transport links between countries and the efficiency of modern transportation
* Border control involves controlling the flow of people, animals and goods across border in between countries
* The greater mekong subregion in southeast asia has necessary border controls to control the spread of drug-resistant malaria across borders
* Malaria spreads through uncontrolled migration and lack of coordination between countries along the border districts
* Travel advisories are official notices that inform travellers about the specific risks of travelling to a particular destination, issued by government agencies
* They are useful in reducing travel to places where the risk of infection is very high
* But, they may not be able to reach everyone, as it cannot reach those without access to news or those who are illiterate

### Environmental challenges

#### Climate change

* Climate affects temperature and the amount of rainfall an area receives
* Changes in temperature and the amount of rainfall affect the behaviour and range of mosquitoes
* Increased temperatures can cause mosquitoes to breed and mature faster
* Increased rainfall also provides more pools of stagnant water for mosquitoes to breed
* These suitable conditions have lengthened the periods in which mosquitoes can breed and transmit malaria
* This results in a greater frequency of malaria infection

#### Monsoons

* The number of malaria cases increases during monsoons
* Monsoons bring high rainfall during the wet seasons
* Rainfall is strongly correlated with the high increase in malaria cases in India
* In urban areas in India, heavy rains create long-lasting pools of stagnant water for mosquitoes to breed, which transmit malaria to the urban population when they mature

## Challenges in managing the spread of HIV/AIDS

### Socio-economic challenges

#### Difficulties in HIV detections

* HIV is difficult to detect because there are no visible signs of the disease for most of the periods of the infection
* Infected people may continue with their normal behaviour, potentially infecting many others
* People with limited access to healthcare have greater difficulty obtaining HIV testing
* A survey was conducted in selected african communities where residents asked if they know if they had HIV, and subsequently had their blood tested for the virus
* Not knowing one's HIV status was a major cause for the spread of the disease

#### Lifestyle choices

* Lifestyle choices include being sexually active at a young age, having many sexual partners and using injection drugs
* HIV/AIDS can spread through these ways, making it difficult to contain its spread as it may be difficult to influence people's lifestyle choices
* Culture often influences lifestyle choices, making it difficult to manage the spread of HIV/AIDS
* Deeply rooted traditions, values and beliefs cause individuals to continue with risk-taking behavior
* Some tribes in Zambia and Kenya in Africa still practice polygamy, the practise of having more than one wife
* Testing for HIV/AIDS before marriage is not practised in these countries, allowing it to spread further amongst the populations
* Many people still hold inaccurate beliefs about HIV/AIDS

#### Social stigma

* The social stigma associated with HIV/AIDS causes many people to stay away from being tested and receiving treatment
* This increases the spread of the disease, and makes it difficult to contain the spread of the disease
* Millions of people with HIV/AIDS may infect their partners because the social stigma causes them to remain silent about their condition
* The social stigma also causes people to not stay on track with their antiretroviral therapy
* Health professionals may also discriminate against patients infected with HIV, and believe that treating them is a waste of valuable resources, or they may get infected with HIV when treating these patients
* When left untreated, people infected with HIV may spread the disease to others
* Despite progress in reducing social stigma, it still remains a major challenge throughout the world
* In the USA, 27% of americans prefer not to work closely with a women infected with HIV/AIDS

#### High cost of antiretroviral therapy

* Antiretroviral therapy is the application of drugs in the treatment of HIV/AIDS
* This treatment can control the disease, improve the quality of life of life of a patient and reduce the risk of transmission of the disease
* Although treatment is becoming cheaper, it is still costly and unaffordable to many patients
* Some patients cannot afford the transport costs to visit a clinic
* Some patients will have to forgo a day's earnings to visit a clinic
* In Botswana, 25% of the adult population have HIV/AIDS, but patients stop visiting and taking medication due to long waiting time at clinics
* Patients have to wait between 4-12 hours at a typical clinic

#### Population movement across borders and along highways for work

* Mobile populations are often associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS due to their higher mobility
* Truck drivers travel from place to place and spend long hours away from their families
* They are more prone to risk-taking behaviour such as seeking the company of commercial sex workers
* The Kinshasa highway has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS among commercial sex workers along the road

## Managing the spread of infectious diseases

### Individuals

* Individuals can take action to help manage the spread of infectious diseases when they are aware of what the diseases are and the conditions that contribute to their spread
* Being aware about HMFD (Hand, foot and mouth disease) outbreaks in a community could make individuals more mindful about their own hygiene
* Individuals may also become more aware of the likely ways the disease can be transmitted
* Individuals can also exercise social responsibility by being constantly aware of unsanitary conditions or conditions which make it conducive for diseases to spread
* This allows them to take precautionary measures against infectious diseases
* A spray, protective clothing or insecticide treated nets can be used to reduce contact with mosquitoes
* Potential breeding sites can be identified and removed
* Refraining from participating in risk-taking behaviours could make a person less likely to contract diseases
* They can also obtain up-to-date and timely vaccinations and follow travel advisories, making them less likely to contract a disease at new locations or from another person

### Communities

* Communities are social groups that live in a particular area or share a common culture, values or interests
* They play an important role in managing and controlling diseases as strategies need to be implement to address issues specific to the community or area
* They can introduce possible disease control strategies, decide when and where strategies will be implements and by whom, and engage health workers to train and monitor members of the community
* When a disease treatment of programme is community-led, people may be more receptive to advice or information on treatment
* Communities may also be able to provide better support to resident undergoing treatment
* Community-led strategies also empower residents to develop their own solutions based on knowledge of their local conditions
* Community-based mosquito control in Managua, Nicaragua
* Community residents conducted surveys to ascertain neighbourhood residents' existing understanding of dengue and their mosquito control practises
* They also identified mosquito breeding sites and examined households for breeding sites
* From 2004-2007 dengue infection in children declined by more than half
* By 2007, households were 25% less likely to have breeding sites for mosquitoes
* But, the community needs cooperation from the government to deal with water and waste management issues
* Sewers are potential breeding sites for mosquitoes which are not easily accessible by residents, and the government could help monitor these out-of-reach areas for the community

### Governments

#### Precautionary measures

* Governments are actively involved in managing the spread of diseases by carrying out precautionary measures that aim to prevent outbreaks of diseases
* Precautionary measures are strategies used to reduce the occurrence of diseases
* In Thailand, thermal fogging involves the distribution of insecticides by using fog produced by heat
* Under the malaria control programme in Thailand, thermal fogging is applied during malaria outbreaks and in uncontrolled transmission areas
* It is applied once a week for 4 consecutive weeks
* Thermal fogging kills adult mosquitoes found outdoors
* Thermal fogging is expensive and must be carried out on  a regular basis in order to be effective
* The thick fog also causes reduced visibility and is a traffic hazard

#### Mitigation measures

* Mitigation measures are strategies that are used to reduce the impact of a disease or health problem after it has emerged in a country
* These can include the closure of schools and public places during an epidemic
* It may also involve providing healthcare services and requiring doctors to report cases of diseases
* Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA) has a five-pronged approach to vector control
* They launched the 'Do the Mozzie Wipeout' on 28 April 2013 to prevent an outbreak of dengue fever
* The campaign includes community outreach to raise awareness on preventions methods
* The 'colour coded alert system' indicates the seriousness of the dengue situation through colour-coded banners
* The colours indicate the corresponding measures to takes
* The WHO cited Singapore as a good role model in preventing and managing dengue cases and encouraged other countries to learn from Singapore
* The number of cases with more serious dengue fever decreased in recent years since the 2005 dengue fever outbreak
* But, most people are unaware or complacent about Aedes mosquitoes breeding at their place of residents, posing difficulties in preventing the breeding of mosquitoes
* Due to climate change, mosquitoes breed faster at higher temperatures
* People had been infected with Den-1 a new dominant virus that makes the mosquito ready to spread the disease just 3-4 days after it bites an infected person compared to the usual 7 days
* The majority of the population has no immunity against the new virus

### International organisations

* International organisations include the WHO, the World Bank, UNAIDS and other NGOs
* The Getting to Zero was the 2011-2015 UNAIDS (United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS) strategy
* UNAIDS brings together the resources of the UNAIDS secretariat and 10 UN system organisations for coordinated and accountable efforts to unite the world against AIDS
* The vision of UNAIDS is 0 new HIV infections, 0 discrimination and 0 AIDS-related deaths
* Some strategy goals by 2015 include
  * Sexual transmission of HIV reduced by half
  * Universal access to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV who are eligible for treatment
  * HIV-specific needs of women and girls are addressed in at least half of all national HIV responses
* UNAIDS, the Global Fund and the PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS RELIEF) are working closely with the Government of Kenya to eliminate new HIV infections among children and keep their mothers alive
* Kenya has reduced new HIV infections among children by 44% but still reported 13,000 infections among children in 2012
* In many countries, stigma, discrimination, violence against women and girls and other HIV-related abuses of human rights remain widespread and continue to obstruct effective HIV responses
* Despite widespread commitment to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS, cooperation and execution of strategies from government prove to be challenging, making the result far from satisfying

### Non-governmental organisations

* A NGO is a non-profit group which may be organised at a local, national or international level
* NGOs perform a variety of services and humanitarian functions such as bringing citizens concerns to government, supporting and monitoring policies and encouraging political participation
* The International HIV/AIDS alliance (IHAA) has the HIV, Health and RIghts: Sustaining Community Action Strategy from 2013-2020
* The IHAA is a innovative alliance of nationally based, independent, civil society organisations
* Some of the ways the strategy responds to the HIV epidemic include
  * Increasing access to HIV and health programmes
  * Supporting community-based organisations to be connected and supporting effective elements of health systems
  * Advocating for HIV, health and human rights
* Individual countries will take up more ownership in implementing the strategy
* There are measurable goals for the whole alliance
* Organisations that work with IHAA will sue the strategy togther with theiw own national plans to shape their future strategies
* The success of the strategy depends on the will of government to better target their resources and work with civil society in their national HIV responses
* Not all countries have the funds to implement the strategies, and depend on the goodwill of other countries or international organisations to provide funds for them
