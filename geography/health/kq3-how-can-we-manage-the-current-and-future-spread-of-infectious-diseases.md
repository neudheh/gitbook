# KQ3: How can we manage the current and future spread of infectious diseases?

## Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases

* One challenge in managing infectious dieses is the occurrence of emerging and re-emerging diseases
* Emerging infectious diseases are diseases that appear in a population for the first time
* Re-emerging infectious diseases are diseases that may have existed in the population previously, but are rapidly increasing in incidence and geographic range, and may also occur in a different form or location
* Another challenge in managing the spread of infectious diseases is the efficiency of modern transportation and diseases

## Re-emergence of malaria

### Resistance to anti-malaria drugs

* Resistance has increases due to the rise in the use of counterfeit or incomplete doses of antimalarial drugs
* This allows surviving malaria parasites to build resistance to the drug
* A number of Indian migrant workers brought drug resistance malaria back from Thailand, and the existing malaria treatment for the migrant workers became ineffective in India, making it more difficult to contain the spread of malaria

### Air travel

* With increase in air travel, vectors are transported to new areas
* An Anopheles mosquito infected by malaria enters a plane in Asia and bites a passenger
* After leaving the plane in Europe, the passenger is bitten by another anopheles mosquito
* The mosquito acquires the malaria parasite and spread the disease when it takes blood from another person

### Climate change

* When the climate gets warmer, temperatures at higher altitudes increase
* These places become favorable breeding sites for mosquitos due to the increased temperature
* In the Central Highlands region of Kenya, climate change has raised average temperatures and allowed malaria to occur in areas of higher altitudes

### Insecticide-resistant mosquitos

* Mosquitoes build resistance to DDT, a pesticide in a relatively short period of time
* Mosquito resistance to insecticides were detected in 64 countries around the world

## Challenges in managing the spread of malaria

### Limitations of healthcare

* Malaria parasites can develop resistance to anti-malarial drugs
* This is caused by incompletely treating and infected person
* The parasites the survive treatment develop resistance to the drugs
* In 2009. resistance to anti-malaria drugs was observed along the Thai-Cambodian border

### Population movement

* Population movement is the movement of people across borders
* Spreads and transmits diseases to new locations
* Makes malaria control programs ineffective as it is difficult to monitor the movement of people
* The volume and speed of movement is increasing at a larger scale than before due to the ease of travelling
* Border controls are essential where large-scale population movement occurs
  * Border control is controlling the flow of people, animals and goods across border between countries
  * Greater Mekong sub-region in southeast Asia
  * Malaria spread through uncontrolled migration  and lack co-ordination between countries along the border districts
  * Therefore, malaria flourishes along international borders and are transported to relatively low transmission areas
* Travel advisories are official notices that inform travelers about the specific risks of travelling to a particular destination
  * Issued by government agencies
  * Useful in reducing travel to places where risk of infection is very high
  * May not reach everyone, like those without access to news or are illiterate

### Forest clearance

* Forest clearance is the removal of trees in forested areas
* Often cleared for farming activities
* Water tends to accumulate on the surface of the ground to form pools of stagnant water, allowing mosquitoes to breed
* Water in deforested areas is more pH neutral which is suitable for mosquito larva to survive
* Forest clearance in Africa, Asia and Latin America has increased the incidence of malaria
* Destruction of naturally vegetated areas causes biodiversity loss, e.g. predators of mosquitos such as fish birds, dragonflies and bats
  * Biodiversity loss is the reduction in the number of different species of living things
  * The loss of predators allow mosquito populations to increase
* Agriculture has contributed to the rise in mosquito populations
  * Mosquitos have more places to breed due to irrigation-based intensive agriculture, e.g. wet rice farming
  * Flooded rice fields provide conducive environments for mosquitos to breed in

### Climate

* Changes in temperature and the amount of rainfall affect the behavior and range of mosquitoes
* Increased temperatures speed up the rate at which mosquitoes breed and mature
* Increased rainfall provides more pools of stagnant water for mosquitoes to breed
* Suitable conditions lengthen periods in which mosquitoes can breed and transmit malaria
* Results in greater frequency of malaria infection
* [#effect-of-climate](kq2-what-influences-the-spread-and-impacts-of-infectious-diseaeses.md#effect-of-climate "mention")

### Monsoon

* The number of malaria cases increase during monsoons
* Monsoons bring high rainfall during the wet season
* Rainfall is highly correlated with a high increase in malaria cases in India
* [#effect-of-climate](kq2-what-influences-the-spread-and-impacts-of-infectious-diseaeses.md#effect-of-climate "mention")

## Challenges in managing the spread of HIV/AIDS

### Difficulties in HIV detection

* HIV is difficult to detect because there are no visible signs of the disease for most of the period of infection
* Infected people continue with their normal behavior, potentially infecting many others
* People with limited access to healthcare have greater difficulty obtaining HIV testing
* Not knowing one's HIV status can help spread the disease
* A survey in selected African communities was conducted where residents were asked whether they knew they had HIV, and subsequently had their blood tested for the virus
  * Not knowing one's HIV status was a major cause of the spread of the disease

### Lifestyle choices

* Lifestyle choices include
  * Being sexually active at a young age
  * Having many sexual partners
  * Increased drug use
  * [#lifestyle-choices](kq2-what-influences-the-spread-and-impacts-of-infectious-diseaeses.md#lifestyle-choices "mention")
* The difficulty of influencing people's lifestyle choices pose a challenge to containing HIV/AIDS
* Culture often influences lifestyle choices
* Deeply rooted traditions, values and beliefs cause individuals to continue with their risk-taking behavior, e.g. polygamy in some tribes in Zambia and Kenya
* Testing for HIV/AIDs before marriage is not practiced
* Many people still hold inaccurate beliefs about HIV/AIDS

### Social stigma

* Social stigma associated with HIV/AIDS causes many people to stay away from being tested and receiving treatment
* People with HIV/AIDs may infect their partners as they remain silent about their condition
* People do not stay on track with their antiretroviral therapy
* Health professionals may discriminate against patients infected with HIV
* When left untreated, people with HIV may spread the disease to others
* Despite progress in reducing social stigma, this remains a challenge throughout the world
* In the USA, 27% of Americans prefer to not work closely with a woman infected with HIV/AIDS
* â€‹[#social-stigma](kq2-what-influences-the-spread-and-impacts-of-infectious-diseaeses.md#social-stigma "mention")

### Healthcare

* Antiretroviral therapy is the application of drugs in the treatment of HIV/AIDS
* Treatment can control the disease, improve the quality of life of a patient and reduce the transmission of the disease
* Although treatment is becoming cheaper, it is still costly and unaffordable to many patients
* Some patients cannot the transport costs to visit a clinic or will have to forgo a day's earnings to visit a clinic
* In Botswana, 25% of the adult population have HIV/AIDS, but patients stop visiting and taking medication due to the long waiting time at clinics. Patients have to wait between 4-13h at a typical clinic
* [#cost-of-health-care](kq2-what-influences-the-spread-and-impacts-of-infectious-diseaeses.md#cost-of-health-care "mention")

### Population movement

* Mobile populations are often associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS due to their higher mobility, e.g. truck drivers
* More prone to taking risk-taking behavior such as seeking the company of commercial sex workers
* The Kinshasa highway has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS among commercial sex workers along the road
* [#mobility](kq2-what-influences-the-spread-and-impacts-of-infectious-diseaeses.md#mobility "mention")

## Management of the spread of infectious diseases

### Individuals

* Individuals can take action to manage the spread of infectious diseases when there re aware of what the diseases are and the conditions with favor their spread
* Example: Being aware of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) outbreaks can make individuals more mindful of their hygiene and more aware of the likely ways the disease can be spread and take steps to prevent its spread
* Individuals can exercise social responsibility by being constantly aware of unsanitary conditions or conducive conditions for the spread of diseases
* Individuals can take precautionary measures against infectious diseases by reducing contact with mosquitos through the use of a spray, protective clothing or insecticide treated nets, and identifying and removing potential breeding sites
* Refrain form participating in risk taking behaviors
* Obtaining up-to-date and timely vaccinations
* Following travel advisories
* But, individuals can not be socially responsible, and this can cause the spread of diseases

### Communities

* Communities are social groups that live in a particular area or share a common culture, values and interests
* Play an important role in managing and controlling diseases because strategies need to be implemented to address issues specific to the area
  * Introduce possible disease control strategies
  * Deciding when and where strategies will be implemented and by whom
  * Engaging health workers to train and monitor members of the community
* People may be more receptive to advice and information and treatment
* Provide better support to residents undergoing treatment
* Example: Community-based mosquito control in Managua, Nicaragua
  * The community residents conducted surveys to ascertain neighborhood residents' understanding of dengue and their mosquito control practices
  * Identified mosquito breeding sites and examined households for breeding sites
  * From 2004-2007, dengue infection in children declined by more than half
  * By 2007, households were 25% less likely to have breeding sites for mosquitos
  * The community needs cooperation form the government to deal with water and waste management issues
  * Sewers are potential breeding sites for mosquitoes, which are not easily accessible to residents
  * Governments could help monitor these out-of-reach areas on behalf of the community

### Governments

#### Implementation of precautionary measures

* Governments can implement precautionary measures, which are strategies used to reduce the occurrences of diseases
* Example: Thermal fogging in Thailand
  * &#x20;Thermal fogging involves the distribution of pesticides using fog produced by heat
  * Under the malaria control control program in Thailand, thermal fogging is applied during malaria outbreaks and in uncontrolled transmission areas
  * In principle, it is applied once a week for 4 consecutive weeks
  * Kills adult mosquitos found outdoors
  * Expensive and must be conducted on a regular basis in order to be effective
  * Thick fog causes reduced visibility and is a traffic hazard

#### Implementation of mitigation measures

* Mitigations measures are strategies that are used to reduce the impact of a disease or health problem after it has emerged in a country
* Organizing the closure of schools and public places during an epidemic
* Providing healthcare services and require doctors to report cases of diseases
* Example: Singapore's national environment agency (NEA)'s approach to vector control
  * 5-pronged approach to vector control
  * 'Do the mozzie wipeout' launched on the 28th of April 2013 to prevent the outbreak of dengue fever
  * The campaign includes community outreach to raise awareness on prevention measures
  * The color coded alert system indicated the seriousness of the dengue situation through color coded banners
  * The colors indicate the corresponding preventive measures to take
  * The WHO cited Singapore as a good role model in preventing and managing dengue cases and encouraged other countries to learn from it
  * The number of cases with more serious dengue fever has decreased in recent years since the 2005 dengue outbreak
  * Most are unaware or complacent about mosquitoes breeding at their places of residence, posing difficulties in preventing the breeding of mosquitos
  * Mosquitoes breed faster at higher temperatures due to climate change
  * More people had been infected with Den-1, a new dominant virus, which can make a mosquito ready to spread the disease in just 3-4 days after it bites an infected person instead of 7, and majority have no immunity against the virus

### International organizations

* International organizations include a wide variety of groups that operate across countries
* WHO, the World Bank, UNAIDS and other NGOs
* Example: Getting to Zero, 2011-2015 UNAIDS strategy
  * UNAIDS brings together the resources of the UNAIDS secretariat and 10 UN system organization for coordinated and accountable efforts to unite the worlds against AIDS
  * The vision of UNAIDS is zero new HIV infections, Zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths
  * Aimed to&#x20;
    * Reduce sexual transmission of HIV by half
    * Universal access to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV and are eligible for treatment
    * HIV-specific needs of women and girls are addressed by  at least half of all national HIV responses
  * UNAID's support helped to ensure the successful agreement between the government of Kenya and the Global fund for the implementation of its Round 10 grants of US$483 million
  * UNAIDS, the global fund and the President's Emergency plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) are working closely to support the government of Kenya to eliminate new HIV infections among children and keep their mothers alive
  * Since 2009, Kenya has reduced new HIV infection among children by 44% but still reported 13,000 new infections among children in 2012
  * In many countries, stigma, discrimination, violence against women and girls and other GIV-related abuses of human rights remain widespread and continue to obstruct effective HIV responses
  * Cooperation and execution of strategies from governments prove to be challenging despite widespread commitment to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS

### Non-governmental organizations

* A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a non-profit group which may be organized on a local, national or international level
* NGOs perform a variety of services and humanitarian functions
* Bringing citizen concerns to governments, supporting and monitoring policies and encouraging political participation
* Example: International HIV/AIDS alliance (IHAA)'s HIV, Health and rights: Sustaining community action strategy (2013 -2020)
  * The IHAA is an innovative alliance of nationally based, independent, civil society organizations
  * Increasing access to HIV and health programs
  * Supporting community-based organizations to be connected and supporting effective elements of health systems
  * Advocating for HIV, health and human rights
  * Individual countries will take up more ownership in implementing the strategy
  * The success of the strategy depends on the will of government to better target their resources and work with civil society in their national HIV responses
  * Not all countries have the funds to implement the strategies, depending on the goodwill of other countries or international organizations to fund them
