# KQ2: What are the trends and challenges in the production of food crops?

## Trends in the production of food crops from the 1960s

* Intensification refers to the increase in productivity of a farm through an increase in the total crop yield
* Total crop yield is the total amount of crop obtained form an area of farmland
* Productivity is the rate at which the amount of food produce in relation to the resources needed to produce them
* Can be calculated using the Labour per unit area = number of worker/ area of land
* When the same amount of crops on an unit area of land is produced using lesser labour, productivity is higher
* Can also be calculated using the output per unit area = amount of food produced/ area of land
* When the same amount of labour and land produced a higher output, productivity is higher
* Due to rapid population growth and the increase in demand for food, countries have intensified food production to meet the demand

## Intensifying food production

### Physical

#### Climate

* Climate is the average condition of the atmosphere of a specific place over a long period of time, usually over 30 years
* Climate factors like temperature and rainfall affects the growth of plants
* Temperature affects the rates of photosynthesis and seed germination
  * Temperature below 5°C make it very difficult for crops to grow
  * Temperature needed for growth varies among crops
* Rainfall is also important for plant growth
  * The amount of rainfall needed required for growth varies among different types of crops
* High temperatures and high rainfall are more conducive for plant growth
  * The tropics have a daily temperature range of 22-32°C&#x20;
  * They also have average annual rainfall greater than 2,000mm
  * The longer growing season enables farmers to have 2-3 more harvests in a year
* Winter is unsuitable for plant growth, and in places with long winter, food production can only occur during the warm season
  * The Kosovo crop calendar sees precipitation falling as rain and continues through winter as snow, depending upon the altitude of the ara, until May of the following year
  * Land is prepared and sowed from April to June, and the harvest takes place from June to August
* Greenhouses may be used to create optimal conditions for plant growth
  * They help to overcome the short growing season in countries such as the USA, Canada and the Netherlands
  * The key factors in growing crops such as temperature, light and irrigation can be controlled
  * This enables certain crops to be grown throughout the year
* Cattle and poultry need a favourable environment for growth because they may become stressed by extreme hot and cold temperatures
  * When stressed, they are more likely to suffer from infections, produce less milk or fewer eggs or die
  * They are also more likely to suffer from fungal and parasitic diseases, especially when the conditions are wet or moist for a long time
  * They may be placed in shelters to protect them from harsh weather

#### Soils and drainage

* Soil is the top layer of the earth's surface, make up of rocks, mineral particles and organic matter
* Soil fertility depends on the availability of air, water and nutrients from minerals in the soil
* The amount and type of nutrients in soils varies across location
* Fertile soil is rich in minerals needed for plant growth such a nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
* Fertile soils can be found in floodplains along a river, in deltas at the river mouth and in areas near volcanoes
* Highly fertile soils, in combination with flat terrain and a large water supply in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam result in very high production of rice
* Soil drainage refers to the ability of the soil to retain or drain off water
* Improper soil drainage may hinder the growth of crops
* Oats require more sandy soils that are well-drained while soils with more clay and which retain large amounts of water are best for growing rice

#### Relief

* Relief refers to the slope and altitude of a land surface
* When the relief is steep, rain is more likely to remove the topsoil, which is the layer of soil that is rich in nutrients
* The topsoil becomes less stable when it is saturated with water and get washed down the slope
* But, sloping land is suitable for some crops which grow best in well-drained soil, like grapes, tea, coffee
* Slopes can be modified to create flat land for farming
* Terracing is the cutting of steeps into a hillside to create land for cultivation, such as the Longji Rice Terraces in China
* Temperature changes with altitude
* The higher the altitude of a place the lower its temperature will be
* The cooler temperatures of mountainous areas may be suitable for growing certain cool climate crops, such as strawberries

#### Demand and capital

* Demand refers to people's willingness and ability to obtain a particular food crop or product
* The demand for certain types of food affects the intensity of their production, and the amount and type of crops produced
* Demand changes according to the tastes and preferences of consumers
* The amount of capital a consumer has in the form of money or other asses affects whether a demand of a certain food can be ment
* China used to be self-sufficient in corn production, but recently, more corn was needed to feed livestock to meet the demand of a larger and wealthier population
* Thus, they started to import corn from other countries such as the USA, causing them to increase its production of corn to export to China to feed livestock
* This also caused the production of meat in China to increase as well

#### Agribusiness

* Agribusiness is a large farming company which is involved with most industries along a food supply chain, including farming, processing and retailing
* They place importance on scientific and business principles of farming such as research and development of food crops, leading to the high intensity of food production
* They have higher financial capacity than smaller companies, and are able to withstand the impact t of changes in the environment, such as damage to crops caused by pests or flooding

### Political

#### Government policy&#x20;

* A government policy is a plan of action by the government to change a specific situation
* Food security exists when all people are able to obtain sufficient quantities of safe and nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle
* Agricultural policies refer to policies pertaining to domestic agriculture
  * By deciding how limited resources such as money and land may be sued, governments are able to influence the intensity of food production
  * Governments may choose to channel resources into educating farmers on more efficient ways of farming or managing crop prices
  * In India, the Punjab Agriculture Department responded in 2012 to the need to ensure greater productivity form its farmland
  * It started an education programme for its wheat farmer, teaching them about the best available seed varieties, pesticide treatment and irrigation methods
* Food policies refers to a decision made by a government that affects how food is produced, distributed, purchased and packaged
  * Stockpiling is the setting aside and storage of food to ensure food security during emergencies
  * Food can be sourced from local farms or imported from overseas several years in advance
  * By stockpiling, governments would still be able to provide food for their population should there be situations of food shortages or price increase of food items
  * Diversifying the source of food supply is where more food supplies are sourced from more countries to buffer against food shortages and price fluctuations
  * Singapore in the past mainly bought its vegetables from Malaysia. but today, a larger proportion of its vegetables are bought from China and countries as far as the USA
  * The Singaporean government encouraged local companies to place contacts directly with farmers for an agreed amount and price of food products
  * NTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd purchases vegetables through contracts with indonesian farmers
  * This increase in demand for food would increase the production of food, resulting in the intensification of food production

#### ASEAN

* ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is an organisation of 10 southeast asian countries
* It aims to accelerate the region's economic growth, increase social progress, foster cultural development and protect regional peace and stability
* In october 2011, ASEAN signed an agreement with China, Japan and South Korea to ensure food security for its members
* The APTERR (ASEAN Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve) agreement is a commitment form big rice producers to supply rice for a reserve
* During times of disaster, this reserve will be used to provide rice to the countries that have signed the agreement
* China agreed to contribute 300,000 tonnes of rice, Thailand would contribute 15,000 accounts
* Countries contributed financially to fund the operation, such as Singapore contributing US$ 107,500

### Technological (Green revolution)

* The Green Revolution refers to the rapid increase in the productivity of agriculture through the use of science and technology

#### High-yielding Varieties

* High yielding varieties (HYVs) are improved strains of crops such as rice, wheat and other that have an increased growth rate
* They are developed through cross-breeding of selected varieties which are found to exhibit favourable characteristics, such as resistance to pests and diseases or the ability to grow within a shorter growing season so that there can be more harvests in a year
* But they require more water and nutrients to sustain their growth
* IR8, a variety of HYV rice, saved india from famine in the 1960s, enabling farmers to produce twice as much grain as traditional varieties
* 70% of the rice and wheat grown in India where HYVs

#### Fertilisers

* Fertilisers are substance added to the soil to provide nutrients for healthy plant growth
* They are used as nutrients in the soil will be depleted gradually, especially after continuous use of the farmland
* The farmland is not given the chance to fallow, and the small amount of nutrients in the soil will produce a smaller crop yield
* The application of fertilizers will bring nutrients back to the soil, increasing crop yield
* HYVs also require more fertilisers compared to non-HYV crops
* But, they encourage weeds to grow

#### Pesticides

* Pesticides are chemical substances used to kill insects and small animals that destroy crops
* Herbicides are used to kill weed and other undesirable plants that compete with crops for resources
* The pesticide Malathion was used widely in the 1980s to address a fruit fly problem in fruit orchids in California USA
* The use of pesticides is necessary to fight the high level of pest damage that frequently occurs when only a single crop covers a wide area
* With the removal of pests, the corp is protected, increasing crop yield

#### Irrigation

* Irrigation is the method of supplying water to the land other than by natural means such as rain to help crop grows
* Irrigation has increased the amount of arable land worldwide by supplying water to areas that used to be too dry for farming
* The Great Man-mad river is one of the most extensive projects in the world, making it possible to grow crops in the Sahara Desert
* It is a network of underground pipes, canals, wells, reservoirs and tunnels that draws water deep from underground aquifers deep in the Sahara desert
* Flood irrigation is when water is delivered to a whole surface, while centre-pivot irrigation is a form of overhead sprinkler irrigation

#### Mechanisation

* Mechanization has allowed farmers to use more advanced machinery to preform tasks which they would otherwise have to do manually, speeding up the processes involved in preparing the land, tending to crops and harvesting

## Effects of intensifying food production

### Irrigation

* Excessive irrigation may cause the ground to be waterlogged, which occurs when too much water seeps into the soil adn causes it to be over-saturated
* This causes the roots to be deprived of air and nutrients that the crops need, causing them to die
* Salinization occurs when water added to the soil during irrigation evaporates directly from the moist soil, causing salt to be left behind on the soil after evaporation
* Salinisation can also occur when there is no proper drainage of excess water
* The groundwater may reach the upper soil layers, bringing up dissolved salts from the ground
* Saline salts are those in which the concentration of salt is too high for crops to grow well
* Salt is commonly found in the Murray-Darling Basin landscapes and rivers in Victoria, Australia
* It is characterised by low terrain, low rainfall and high evaporation rate
* The naturally occurring salts become concentrated in some parts of the Murray-Darling Basin due to human activities such as irrigation development and land clearing, causing salinisation

### Chemicals

* The overuse of fertilizer and pesticides causes chemicals to become concentrated in the soil
* Over time, they seep into groundwater contaminating it
* They may also be washed into rivers and streams by surface runoff
* When these chemical reach the streams and rivers, they become nutrients of algae to grow
* This causes eutrophication, which is  the presence of excess nutrient in the water, leading to algae bloom
* Algae blooms deplete the oxygen in the water and block sunlight from reaching aquatic plants, resulting in the death of aquatic plants and other organisms such as fish
* In the USA, it was found that pesticides from the farmland have contaminated the groundwater, which is a major problem for the USA as 23% of freshwater used in the country comes from groundwater
* Can be managed by implementing control measures aimed at preventing nutrients from reaching water bodies such as measures to manage runoff
* Raising awareness about eutrophication through public awareness campaigns, school environmental education programmes, and targets outreach within communities

## Why does food shortage still occur?

### Physical

#### Climate change

* Climate change refers to the variation in the global climate or climate patterns in the long term
* Changes in climate may cause existing farmland to become unsuitable for farming, while lengthening the growing season in other areas
* Crops may not longer be able to grow in areas previously suitable for farming, or crops may be farmed in areas which were not suitable for farming in the past
* Some countries and regions across the world could see food production decrease by up to 50%, such as Brazil, India, Pakistan, Turkey, parts of the USA, most of southeast asia and Australia
* Other countries will see their food production increase by 35% due to a rise in temperature, such as France, Russia, Canada, China, Argentina and northern parts of the USA
* The shrinking of glaciers due to global warming is predicted to reduce food supply in the coming deceases
* The seasonal melting of glaciers such as those in the Himalayas provides the river basins of major rivers in India and China with water to irrigate food crops during the dry season
* But these glaciers are receding rapidly and could melt entirely by 2035, leading to a loss of water during the dry season and smaller harvests

#### Extreme weather events

* Extreme weather events are weather events that may cause loss of lives or damage to property, such as droughts, cold waves, heat waves, tropical cyclones
* Droughts reduce water supply available for crops
* Tropical cyclones lead to flooding of farmland
* Extreme weather events may cause crop damage or make id difficult to grow crops, causing significant food shortage
* This is especially so if countries are unable to recover from the loss of crops
* Extreme weather events are likely to become more frequent as a result of climate change
* Cyclone yasi was predicted to destroy half of Queensland, Australia's crops in 2011
* Queensland is among the world's top 3 sugarcane exporters
* A third of the state's crops lies in the direct path on the cyclones and losses from the cyclone could top $500 million
* Banana crops were also in peak season and were destroyed

#### Pests

* Pests are a major contributor to food shortage as they damage food crops, such as wild rabbits, moles, insects
* The caterpillar  in invasion in 2009 by the armyworms in Libera caused a state of emergency to be declared
* Caterpillars devoured all the crops in their path, and the invasion affected 46 villages in northern Liberia, posing a major threat the the already serious food security situation

### Political

#### Civil strife

* Civil strife is a situation in which a country faces major internal conflicts, including riots, unrest or civil war
* It can lead to disputes over the control of resources that affect food production, such as land and water
* These resources may even be destroyed, which in turn would hinder food production
* Landmines planted on farmlands can reduce or completely stop food production during and after a conflict
* Sometimes, the lack of food supply is the root cause of conflict, which could start a vicious cycle of civil strife and shortage of food
* The Syrian village of Houla was the site of a massacre of over 100 people in may 2012, caused a critical shortage of food, water, medical supplies and fuel
* Because of the insecurity, they did not receive distributions of supplies for 10 months
* There was a shortage of fluor and other food items and when they were available, families had no money to buy them and had to sell their land to buy food
* There was no harvesting, many of the cattle had been lost

#### Poor governance

* Governance is the exercise of economic and political authority to manage a country's affairs
* Poor governance such as corruption, policy errors and inability to implement policies can cause food shortages
* Governments can threaten food security when the priorities other developmental needs of the country over ensuring food security
* Local farmers would be then left with smaller plots of land for farming, and therefore a smaller crop yield
* The Indian state of Madhya Pradesh in 2010 saw 40,000 villagers being deprived of land for farming due to the development of mining, steel plants and a port
* Villagers lost the means to produce their own food and were left with extremely limited  income to buy food

### Economic

#### Rising demand for meat and dairy products from emerging economies

* A number of LDCs have developing economies that grow at rates that allow them to contribute significantly to the global economy, in particular BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China)
* These countries have demonstrated high increase in food demand, especially for food products such as meat and dairy products
* This is due to the rising disposable income in LDCs, causing more people to afford these food products
* The sustained growth in demand for food for these countries are depleting global food inventories, especially grain
* Mainly caused by a rapidly growing urban middle class with more purchasing power and changing food preferences, resulting in food shortages in poorer countries

#### Soaring cost of fertilisers and transport

* The cost of fertilisers and transport can directly affect the cost of food
* As the price of fertilizers increases, the cost of producing food will increase, and hence the price of food will increase as well
* There is also a direct relationship between food prices and transport costs
* Energy costs, especially oil are partly responsible for the increase in price of fertilizers as well as transport
* As fuel costs increase, transport costs and machine operation costs increase as well, hence as a result, the prices of food rise in tandem
* Modern agriculture uses petroleum products to fuel farm machinery and transport farm produce, within the farm and to the consumer
* In March 2011, world crude oil prices increased by 10.3%, causing Kazakhstan, a major producer of wheat to increase the price of week exported to neighboring countries such as Tajikistan due to the rise in fuel costs
* Increases in food prices are generally transferred to the consumer, but especially the poor, who already spend a large proportion of their income is already spent on food
* Any increase in food prices may result them in being unable to afford enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs

#### Conversion of farmland to industrial crop production to produce biofuel crops

* As growing crops for industrial use is more profitable than growing food crops, many companies and farmers have converted their farmland to grow crops for biofuels
* Biofuels are fuels that derive energy from biological carbons instead of fossil fuels such as coal
* Biofuel crops are those such as corn, sugarcane and palm oil
* Rising demand has caused production of these biofuels to increase
* In 2009, 25% of all food crops grown in the USA became fuel for vehicles instead of food for people
* THe amount would have been enough to feed 330 million people for 1 year
* From 2006-2007, 30% of increase in food prices is related to the production of biofuels

### Social

#### Lack of access

* Accessibility to food refers to how easily residents can reach the food that is available
* Transport facilities such a road and rail links must be made available so that food can be reached even by  people who live beru far away
* The accessibility of food depends on the number and location of food outlets
* In LDCs, food outlet may be few and far apart from each other
* People in these areas may be unable to obtain fresh produce and have a smaller food intake

#### Inadequate logistics of food distribution and storage

* Food distribution is the movement of food from farms to retail outlets
* This depends on the presence of a good transport network
* Accessibility is affected due to physical barrier such as mountains or events such as landslides, affecting the stability of food supply
* This is particularly significant when the local population cannot meet local demand, making food imports necessary
* A thirds of the population of Timor-Leste experiences food shortages between harvests, and this is worsened by the lack of storage facilities and the difficulty of accessing the numerous remote communities in the country

#### Rapid population growth

* The high birth rates and high population growth rates in LDCs result in a situation where food supply may be unable to meet the growing demand for food
* The world's population will reach 10 billion by 2050 and matching this population growth rate with an increase in food production is critical in ensuring food security
* By 2025, 75% of Sub-Saharan Africans will have to rely on food aid
* The already small amount of land suitable for farming has been further declining due to rising temperatures, posing a threat to food production and security in the region
* The situation is worsened by the high population growth in the region in bot urban and rural areas
