# KQ1: How and why have food consumption patterns changed since the 1960s?

* Food refers to any nutritious substance that is consumed by the body
* Global food consumption patterns cary between DCs and LDCs over time
* These can be seen in the terms of the indicators of food consumptions and changing food preferences
* Their levels of development can be measured using a number of indicators

| Economic                                | Social              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Gross Domestic Produce per capita (GDP) | Adult literacy rate |
| Employment opportunity                  | Life expectancy     |

## Indicators of food consumption

### Food consumption per capita

* Food consumption per capita refers to the average amount of food a person consumes per year, measured in kilogrammes per capita per year
* It may also be recorded for cereals, meat and vegetables
* It is also used to determine changes in food consumption patterns over time
* DCs consume much higher amounts of meat and vegetables per capita than LDCs, and higher amounts of food overall

### Total daily calorie intake

* The total daily calorie intake represents the total number of calories obtained for food consumption per person each day
* The average recommended daily calorie intake is 2,500-3,500 calories per person each day
* People in DCs are likely to have a higher daily calorie intake than LDCs, but the total daily calorie intake has been increasing for both

### Starchy staples as the percentage of all calories

* Staple food forms the main part of the diet, supplying a major proportion of a person's energy and nutrients needs
* Most of the world's staple food such as cereals are high in starch, the most common form of carbohydrate, a chemical compound which supplies to body with energy
* Cereals consists of  grains such as wheat and rice
* People in DCs have a lower intake of starchy staples than people in LDCs

## Changing food preferences

### DCs

* Generally consume more food than people in LDCS
* The consumption of cereals is lower in DCs with is increase in income
* As income goes up, one type of cereal such as rice is substituted for another like wheat used to make bread and noodles
* An increase in income leads to a higher consumption of meat, thus consumption of meat is still high
* But there is a general increase in consumption of healthy food, due to the rise in the number of illnesses related to a high consumption of fats such as heart disease and diabetes
* There is an increase in consumption of leaner meats
* The increased awareness of the health benefits of fruits and vegetables caused increased consumption of fruits and vegetables

### LDCs

* General increase in food consumption after the 1960s, but the rate of increase is lesser than that of DCs
* There is still a high amount of cereals being consumed
* There is an increase in the consumption of non-staple food, such as the consumption of meat and fish due to an increase in income
* Consumption of fruit and vegetables have increased due to the increase in income

## Why do food consumption pattern vary between DCs and LDCs?

### Economic

#### Disposable income

* Disposable income is the amount to income left to an individual after taxes have been paid
* Rising income results in higher disposable income
* People in DCs generally have higher disposable income than people in LDCs
* Disposable income has been increasing for both DCS and LDCs
* The higher one's income, the higher their purchasing power, allowing people to consume a larger amount and more variety of food
* People would consume more meat and lesser cereals as meat consumptions is generally associated with wealth and status
* The quality of diet also increases, but only in DCs as people are now able to afford food that has certain health benefits that are more expensive
* People in DCs have enough food to meed basic nutritional needs, and have sufficient variety of food
* People in LDCs have difficulty in getting enough food to meed basic nutritional needs

#### Pricing

* Increases in food prices affect LDCs more than DCs, as many people in LDCS have lesser disposable income than DCs
* From 2006-2008, food prices rise dramatically worldwide, creating a global food crisis
* The sharp rise in food prices caused people in LDCS finding themselves unable to afford staple food
* The increase in food prices sparked food riot and street protests in LDCS
* In DCs, the effects were not as dramatic, but food prices rose significantly, causing people to select less expensive options instead

### Socio-cultural

#### Food preferences

* People's concerns relating to health, moral principles, income and the environment influence their choices about the food they consume
* Religious reasons could also influence people's diets
* Fast food refers to food that can be prepared easily and quickly, and may be eaten as a quick meal or packaged for take away
  * Due to the convenience and affordable pricing, more people opt to dine at these outlets
  * Globalization has made it possible for fast food chains to set up restaurants in LDCs such as India, causing more people to patronise these outlet rather than local food stalls
  * In DCs, although fast food is popular, people are now trying to move away from eating too much fast food as they become increasingly aware of the harmful effects on human health
  * People have become more concerned over how fast food is being prepared and processed with the use of large amounts of oil, processed meat and chemicals used

#### Population growth

* Population growth is one of the key drivers in the increasing demand for food worldwide
* Population growth rates are higher in LDCs than in DCs due to the higher birth rates as a result of a lack of family planning and a need for farm labour in many LDCs
* Therefore, the increasing demand for food over the years is greater in LDCs than in DCs, from an already limited source

### Political

#### Stability of food supply

* A country has stable food supply when safe and nutritious food is available to all people at all times
* Not all countries have a stable food supply, thus government need tot ake action to increase food supply
* Governments may take action either by increasing food production or increasing food imports
* Food production can be increased by improving technology in order to increase crop yield, as well as increasing the use of agricultural land by opening new areas for agriculture
* Although LDCS have the capacity to increase their agricultural land, they have a lower ability to increase food supply compared to DCs
* LDCs generally lack the access to technology or the finances to implement technology on a large scale
* DCs can increase food imports more easily than LDCs
* LDCs are less able to deal with fluctuations in food prices, hence importing the food can be problematic

#### Civil war

* Wars and conflicts among nations may threaten food supply as crops and livestock may be destroyed
* Farmers may abandon their fields to escape was or conflict
* The civil war in Libya in April 2011 raised safety concerns that restricted people from venturing out to buy or find food
* Food stocks in the country were rapidly being depleted and not being replenished
* Cities and areas with heavy fighting reported food and water shortages

#### Natural disasters

* Natural disasters such as flood, droughts and earthquakes and hurricanes can wipe out entire harvests
* Zimbabwe was hit with a extreme dry weather in 2008, destroying most of the maize harvest, causing a food shortage

#### Food safety

* Food safety refers to a system that provides guidelines and ensure proper handling, preparation and storage of food that prevents foodborne diseases
* It it important to ensure food is safe for consumption
* The government of a country plays an important role in ensuring food safety, by setting food safety standards and ensuring they are met
* They also track down contaminated foods that cause outbreaks of foodborne diseases and removing those foods from the shelves
* The Japan earthquake of 2011 sparked concerns over radiation in japanese food imports, causing Singapore to resits seafood imports for many months

## Consequences of inadequate food consumption

### Health

#### Malnutrition

* Malnutrition is a condition in which the body does not get the sufficient or balances amount of nutrients it  needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ functions
* It can result in death or long term development problems in individuals
* Malnutrition was the underlying cause of all child deaths associated with diarrhoea, pneumonia, malaria and means in 2009
* 52.5% of all deaths in young children under 5 years of age were caused by malnutrition
* Of the 148 million underweight children throughout the world, 78 million are in South Asia and 26 million are in Sub-saharan Africa
* Each year, 5 million children under 5 years of age die of malnutrition in LDCs&#x20;
* LDCs are more heavily affected by malnutrition than DCs

#### Starvation

* Starvation is the state of extreme hunger from a severe lack of food
* It is a extreme form of malnutrition
* When going through starvation, the body becomes skeletally thin and the organs becomes permanently damage
* If starvation is not addressed, the person will eventually die
* It is more common in LDCs due to the greater number of people living in poverty, the lack or absence of resources to recover from natural disasters and unstable political situations, such a rebellions and wars
* In Malin in 2012, 5 million people were threatened with starvation due to a poor harvest and a civil rebellion that took place earlier in the year

### Economic

#### Lower productivity

* Insufficient food consumption can have a negative impact on the economy
* When workers consume imbalanced amounts of nutrients, they fall sick more often, lowering their productivity, which is the rate at which good or services are produced
* Lower productivity will lead to lower income, due to inability to work as productively as before
* Children suffering from inadequate food consumption will fall sick more often, leading to the loss of school days and subsequently the loss of educational opportunities

#### Diversion of financial resources to healthcare

* Public health expenditures will increase when the demand for health service increases due to more people falling sick.
* This increases the overall cost of providing healthcares
* For LDCs, the higher spending on healthcare means that financial resources are diverted from other areas such as education, housing, transportation or even agriculture
* This can slow down the country's economic development and growth

#### Long-term debt due to food and financial aid

* Food aid and financial aid can be given to help people and countries cope with insufficient supply of food
* But, finanica; aid may lead to long-term debt problems for the receiving country
* The USA contributes about half of all global aid. btu most of the food must be bought from their supplies and transported on their ships
* Food supplied as aid is 34% more expensive than purchased locally
* LDCs incurred losses amounting to US$ 5-7 billion
* Rather than helping the country, such aid, often called ties aid serves to increase the national debt of  LDCs to DCs

### Political

#### Social unrest

* Social unrest is a political situation in which people protest or behave violently, often to communicate their unhappiness about a political system
* Food prices in Mozambique increased by as much as 30% in 2010, due to a drought in Russia that decreased its wheat productions, in turn increasing the price of wheat sold to Mozambique
* This sparked violent protests, leaving 400 injured and 10 dead

### Social

#### Scavenging

* Scavenging is searching through things that others people have thrown away
* Food is so hard to come by that scavengers eat whatever they can find in order to prevent starvation
* Scavenging carries health risks because scavenged food may contain high levels of bacteria of chemicals, such as heavy metals of mercury and lead
* It could sould place people in dangerous or illegal situations in search of food, such as trespassing private property
* Scavengers are  also perceived as a nuisance to the public, and thus are sometimes verbally or physically harassed
* In the the large landfill known as Smokey Mountain, in Manila, Philippines, many poor families had set up their makeshift home near the dump to have easy access to waste, and make their living by picking through the landfill's rubbish

## Consequences of excessive food consumption

### Health

#### Obesity and related illnesses

* Obesity is the condition of having excessive fat accumulation due to overconsumption of nutrients, to the extent that it may have a negative impact on health
* Obesity affects most of the body's systems and can lead to health problems such as high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers
* Obesity is more common in DCs than LDCs
* DCs such as the USA have a high percentage of the adult population with obesity as compare to LDCs such as india
* This is due to the higher disposable income and stronger purchasing power, leading to higher calorie intakes of the people in DCs than the people in LDCs
* Obesity is increasing in LDCs, due to rising income in LDCs such as Brazil, South africa, China and India

### Economic

#### Lower productivity

* THe health impact of obesity have result more workers being absent from work and taking more days of leave due to obesity related health issues
* This leads to lower productivity, which the the rate at which good and services are produced
* Lower productivity can lower income as they are now less productive than before
* Children suffering from obesity may fall sick more often, leading to a loss of school days and loss of educational opportunities
* Employees who are absent from work may cost companies millions in productivity and insurance costs
* Even if the employee is present at work, their poor health may make them less productive

#### DIversion of financial resources to healthcare

* Public health expenditure increases as a result of treating obesity-related health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes
* When more people suffer from obesity-related diseases, government will have to channel more funds to the healthcare system
* This would reduce the amount of funds remaining for economic development
* When other sectors of the economy receive less moderary support form the government with time, the overall progress of a country can decline

### Social

#### Food wastage

* Societies with excessive food available for consumption may result in large amounts of food being wasted
* Food wastage is a serious problem in DCs, where both food producers and consumer throw away food that is still edible
* This affects the country because it contributes to more waste that must be disposed of, putting strain on landfills
* Such wastage also means that resources such as water and oil sued to produce the food are wasted as well

#### Dieting

* People may become overweight due to excessive food consumption, causing them to choose to go on a diet in order to lose weight
* Dieting is the practise of regulating the amount of food consumed in order to maintain an ideal body weight
* Dieting provides individual health benefits, and provides employment and value to an economy
* But, inappropriate dieting may lead to depression adn dieting-related physical illnesses such as iron-deficiency anemia
