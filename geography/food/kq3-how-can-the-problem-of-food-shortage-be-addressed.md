# KQ3: How can the problem of food shortage be addressed?

* Food shortage is a major concern in many parts of the world
* The issue of food shortage within one country may have an impact on other countries
* Addressing food shortage may require various countries to cooperate and share knowledge and resources

## Technological

### Storage

* Storage is the use of refrigerated warehouse storage or refrigerated delivery trucks to keep the food fresh for a longer period of time
* In LDCs, farmer make use of simple but effective technologies such as silos

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Crops can be distributed from places further away from its area of production              | The refrigeration of food on a large scale is expensive and adds to the production costs |
| By building silos in Timor-Leste, the FAO has reduced the loss of crops to pests by 20-40% | Fungus can continue when grains have not been dried before being stored in silos         |

### Farming technology

* The use of HYVs, irrigation technology, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and machinery to increase crop yields
* These dramatic improvements in technology since the 1960s are known as the green revolution
* IR8, a variety of HYV rice, saved india from famine in the 1960s, enabling farmers to produce twice as much grain as traditional varieties

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Food can be places previously considered unsuitable for agriculture | Many farming technologies are too expensive for many farmers, especially in LDCs |
| Increased crop yield for farmers                                    | The technologies may result in environmental problems if not properly manages    |
| Farmers can now farm more efficiently                               |                                                                                  |

### Biotechnology

* Refers to the science of modifying living organisms such as plants and animals
* When use the production of food, it is generally known as genetic modification (GM)
* GM foods refers to food derived from crops that have the genetic makeup modified
* Drought resistant corn which is tolerant of low rainfall condition can be grown on the Western Great Plains of the USa, where the maximum rainfall received in the areas ia bout 600mm

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GM crops have a higher yield than non-GM crops, helping farmer to earn a higher income and countries to become sufficient in self-production | GM crops require higher capital investment, and are unaffordable for many small farmers |
| Food can be grown in places previously considered unsuitable for agriculture                                                                 | Consumers are wary of consuming GM food due to the potential health risks               |
|                                                                                                                                              | The use of biotechnology is limited in other crops such as cassavas and bananas         |

## Agricultural

### Multiple cropping and crop rotation



* Multiple cropping is the practise in which the total crop production form a single piece of land is achieved by growing single crops one after another, or growing several crops simultaneously
* In Garhwal Himalaya, India, a practice known as abranaja involves sowing 12 or more crops on the same field
* The crops include various types of beans an millet
* The crops are harvested at different times of the year

| Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Disadvanntages                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-leguminous crops  (corn) can be planted next to leguminous crops (soya bean) as leguminous crops have roots that contain bacteria in their root systems the produce nitrogen compounds and can act as fertiliser for other plants | Time consuming because they need to manage multiple crops at one time to ensure all crops are growing well |
| Minimises the problem of pests as crops sucha s garlic, pepper and onions may be planted next to other crops such as tomatoes                                                                                                         | Might not be able to maximise crop yield with so many crops planted on a single field                      |
| Dependence on one crop is avoided so that variability in prices, market, climate and pests and diseases do not have such drastic effects on local economies                                                                           |                                                                                                            |

### Water and soil conservation

* Soil conservation is where soil is protected against erosion or deterioration, allowing the soil to remain fertile for a longer period to time
* The increased soil fertility leads to higher crop yield
* No-till farming is farming without removing weeds from the soil and without creating rows in the soil for planting
* It helps to conserve water and soil, allows plant materials form the previous growing season to be kept of the surface to the soil
* Maintains the quality of the soil through decomposition of dead plant materials that return nutrients to the soil
* In contrast, tilling removes plant materials as it diminishes organic matter in the soil, and heavy machinery used to till the soil causes the soil to be compacted over time, preventing water from reaching the roots

### Leasing of farmland to other countries

* Some countries may lease out farmland to countrie which do not have sufficient land for faming
* South Korea negotiated a 99 year lease on 3.2 million acres of farmland in Madagascar
* But, in Ethiopia, where several million rely on food aid, farmland is leased out to other countries to generate income for the country, causing lesser land to be available for local farmers, worsening food shortage in the country

| Leasing out land may generate income that can help local farmers improve their farming methods | Leasing out land could reduce the local food supply, especially  in countries with do not have sufficient food |

## Social

### Support local farmers

* Consumers can support local farmers by purchasing locally sourced food
* Local farms in Singapore produce mainly leafy vegetables and beansprouts, and the leafy vegetables and beansprouts produced, amounting to $20 million in value, are wholly consumed by the domestic market

| Sucesses                                                                                                                      | Limitations                                                                                                                                 |

| Less reliant on imports, enhancing food security                                                                              |                                                                                                                                             |
| Keeps local farmers in business by ensuring demand for their produce and helping them maintain their share of the food market |                                                                                                                                             |

### Population control

* The growth in food production is slower than population growth, which is a concern for countries with widespread hunger and malnutrition
* Controlling the population growth is essential to ensure that people have sufficient food
* Can be done by educating people on family planning and giving them access to reproductive health facilities
* The supply of traditional staples such as fish are not sufficient to meet the increasing demand for food due to high population growth in the philippines
* Community-based planning programmes have been started to provide people with contraceptives, helping to slow down population growth to alleviate the problem of food shortage
* However, family planning is bounded by cultural values and hence difficult to be successful if people are not receptive to the birth control measures

## Political

### National strategies

* National strategies are strategies that are implemented within a country
* they may involve the whole country or selected parts of it, such as regions involved in agricultural production
* May include agricultural policies , which are laws pertaining to domestic agriculture
* It works together with the food policy to achieve food security for the country
* In Malaysia, the FELDA (Federal Land Development Authority) Schemes aimed to reduce poverty in rural areas through agricultural activities
* This involved the development of unused land for agriculture and settlement, providing farmers with land seeds and tools for farming, add the building of modern processing facilities for crops

| More than 90,000 families, most of whom were involved in agricultural activities, ahd been resettle under the FELDA scheme by 1985 | Cash crops are favoured over food crops due to higher revenue, and most cash crops are long-term crops that require high capital |
| Nearly a million acres of jungle have been transformed into farms                                                                  | Cash crops are subjected to fluctuations of world price, posing a high risk to farmers                                           |

### International strategies

* International strategies are strategies that are implemented across many countries
* May involve countries across the world or within a region like southeast asia
* May include food programmes and food aid initiated by international organisations
* Food programmes are activities that may be introduced either by national governments or international organisations such as the UNWFP (United Nations World Food Programme) and the World Bank
* They are designed to address specific food shortage issues
* Are a form of food aid, which refers to the granting the access of food to all people through international funding and support
* One example of a food programmes is responding to emergencies, which is the provision of emergency food assistance during wars and natural disasters
