## Account for the occurrences of rainfall over the 5 days

1: When rainfall occurs

* Rainfall occurs at hours where the temperature is highest in the day/ after high temperatures
* Data
  * On Saturday, the temperature was highest at 32Â°C at 12 pm, when heavy rains occurred
  * Rainfall occurred at the highest temperatures for everyday in the 5 days

2: Explanation

* This is due to convectional rainfall due to intense heating of the earth's surface
* Air heats up, expands and rises
* At dew point temperature, it cools down and condenses to form clouds
* When the water droplets are large and heavy enough, they fall as rain

## Location of Occurrence and Characteristics of tropical cyclones

* They are weather systems that develop over tropical and sub-tropical waters, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans respectively (state where the cyclone originated)
* Cyclone Yasi circulates clockwise, whereas Hurricane Katrina circulates counter-clockwise (direction of circulation)
* They have a low pressure center at the eye, where skies are clear and winds are calm
* Winds are more than 64 knots (wind speed)

## Impacts of cyclones

* Both had very strong winds of about 280 km/h
* Due to the strong winds, both cyclones generate storm surges
  * Hurricane Katrina brought about a higher storm surge of up to 8.2m at Florida and Mississippi, whereas Cyclone Yasi's storm surge was lower at 5m at Cardwell
* Both cyclones brought torrential rainfall
  * Cyclone Yasi produced more rainfall of at least 400mm in places such as South Mission Beach and Zatta, whereas Hurricane Katrina produced less rainfall, the highest was 380mm at Louisiana
* Both cyclones are Category 5 with wind speeds of more than 250 km/h, they are great damages to infrastructure such as devastated buildings in Mission Beach, Tully and Cardwell
  * The strong winds would have ripped off the roof of buildings and caused the electrical poles to topple over, disrupting communications
* The death toll was much lower for cyclone Yasi at (1 vs 1836) as the Australians could be more prepared and evacuated to safety
* Hurricane Katrina resulted in a US$91 Billion in repair bill as torrential rain flooded the land, and restoration of water supply, electricity, house would incur more costs

## Path and characteristics

* Hurricane Irene was formed over the Atlantic ocean and moved from the Caribbean Islands of Haiti and the Bahamas towards the western coast of USA, making landfall on August 27 at cape lookout
* It brought strong winds at the speed of 135 km/h and heavy rainfall of 20cm was received in a day at the coastal areas
* The strength of the hurricane subsided as it approached land from Cape Lookout to New York at 105 km/h
* Hurricane Irene traveled a total distance of about 700-800 km, from Cape Lookout, where landfall was made, to New York, where it began to dissipate
