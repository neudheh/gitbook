# KQ1: Why do different places experience different weather and climate?

* **Weather** is the condition of the atmosphere at a particular place and time. It affects how we live from day to day
* **Climate** is the average condition of the atmosphere of a specific place over a long period of time, usually over 30 years

## Elements of Weather

### Temperature

* Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a place
* Determined by the energy from the sun which reaches the earth
* Energy from the sun mostly travels through the atmosphere and is absorbed by the earth's surface, causing it to warm up, which heats up the atmosphere
* Measured in degrees Celsius (°C) using an analogue and or digital thermometer
* A maximum and minimum thermometer is used to measure maximum and minimum temperature

#### Latitude

* **Latitude** is the distance of any point on the earth measure north or south from the equator
* Latitude is made up of imaginary horizontal lines running from east to west around the earth and are measured in degrees
* The earth tilts at 23.5° on its own axis and as a result, the sun's rays strike at various angles at different parts of the earth
* Temperatures are lower at higher latitudes because the solar angle is lower, meaning that the rays struck at a lower angle and the solar energy is spread out over a wider area
* As the solar angle is high at the area between the Tropic of Cancer and the equator, heat from the sun is concentrated on a small area

#### Altitude

* **Altitude** is the height of a place in relation to the sea level
* Temperature generally decreases by 6.5°C every 1000 meters increase in altitude
* Temperature decreases with altitude mainly because the atmosphere is mostly heated by the earth's surface
  * The sun's solar energy enters the atmosphere and reaches the earth's surface in the form of shortwave radiation.
  * About 45% is absorbed by the earth's surface, heating it up
  * The warm surface emits heat in the form of longwave radiation
  * The higher up the atmosphere you go, the further you are from the surface from the earth which is heated by the sun
* Longwave radiation that is emitted by the earth is absorbed by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
  * When the atmosphere absorbs longwave radiation, the sun's solar energy is trapped, and this warms the earth
  * Air that is nearer to the earth's surface absorbs more heat from longwave radiation than air at higher altitudes
* Air is less dense at higher altitudes
  * Dense air is able to absorb more heat from longwave radiation from the earth's surface, resulting in higher temperatures
  * The less dense air on top of a mountain has less ability to absorb heat than the denser air at sea level, resulting in lower temperatures on top of the mountain

#### Distance from the sea

* The sea heats up and cools down more slowly than the land
* The difference in the rate of heating and cooling of the sea and land affects the temperature of coastal and inland areas
* **Maritime effect** is the effect that large ocean bodies have on the climate of coastal areas, causing coastal areas to have a smaller annual temperature range
  * During summer, the air over the sea is cooler than the air over the land, because the land heats up quickly while the sea heats up more slowly
  * The cooler air over the sea helps to lower the temperature of coastal areas, therefore coastal areas are cooler than places inland
  * During winter, the air over the sea remains warmer than the air over the land because the sea cols more slowly than the land
  * The warmer air over the sea helps to increase the temperature of coastal areas, as compared to the cooler inland areas
  * Due to the maritime effect, coastal areas experience cooler summers and warmer winders, and a smaller annual temperature range than inland areas
* **Continental effect** is the effect that continental surfaces have on the climate of inland areas, causing inland areas to have a larger temperature range
  * As these areas are further away from the sea, the temperatures of these areas are not influence by the sea
  * They experience warmer summers and colder winders, and a larger annual temperature range than coastal areas

#### Cloud cover

* **Cloud cover** is the extent of the the sky that is covered by clouds
* More cloud covers means a smaller difference in day and night temperatures, so the diurnal range is smaller
* **Presence of clouds**
  * During the day, clouds reflect a large portion of the sun's energy back to space, keeping the earth's surface cool. They absorb heat radiated from the earth's surface at the same time
  * During the night, clouds absorb more of the heat that is radiated from the surface and prevent it from escaping into safe, keeping the air near the earth's surface warm at night
* **Absence of clouds**
  * During the day, the absence of clouds allow large amounts of the sun's energy to reach the earth. The earth's surface heats up quickly, so air near the earth's surface is warmer
  * During the night, the absence of clouds allows more of the heat radiated from the earth's surface to escape into space, and the air near the earth's surface is cooler at night

### **Relative humidity**

* Relative humidity is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) between the actual amount of water vapor present in a mass of air and the maximum amount of water the air could hold at any given temperature
* Measured using a sling psychometer, with a wet and dry bulb thermometer
* Varies with temperature, as warm air can hold more water than cold air
* When temperature increases, the amount of water in the air stays the same, but the rise in temperature makes air able to hold more water vapor, causing relative humidity to decrease
* **Saturation** occurs when relative humidity is at 100%, when the air holds the maximum amount of water vapor it can hold
* The temperature at which saturation occurs is known as the dew point temperature
* Condensation starts to occur at dew point temperature
* **Condensation** is a process in which water vapor changes to a liquid by cooling

### Clouds

* When the earths surface is heated up, liquid water is converted to water vapor through a process known as **evaporation**
* As water vapor rises, it starts to cool. When it cools to dew point temperature, condensation takes place if there are tiny particles for the water vapor to condense on
* These tiny particles such as dust are known as condensation nuclei
* The water droplets in the air will merge and become larger in a process known as **coalescence**, forming clouds
* **Clouds** are visible masses of water droplets or ice crystals that are suspended in the atmosphere from the condensation of water vapor
* The water droplets may eventually grow large enough to fall to the earth's surface as precipitation

### Rainfall

* Precipitation refers to water in any form that falls from the atmosphere to the surface of the earth
* Includes hail, snow, sleet and rain
* The main form of precipitation in the tropics is rain
* Areas with a rainfall above 1500 mm have high rainfall, while areas with lesser than 250mm have low rainfall
* Measured in millimeters using a rain gauge
* Rainfall is the result of air instability, which is the tendency of a parcel to air to raise (unstable) rather than remain in its original position (stable)
* When a parcel of air is cooler than the surrounding air, it sinks and remains near the grounds, and it is stable
* When air is heated, it expands, becomes less dense than the surrounding air and raises, and it is unstable

#### Convectional rain

* Convectional rain occurs when the earth's surface is heated intensely
* Common in the tropics which receive a great amount of sunlight
* As the sun's energy heats up the earth surface, the warm surface heats up the air around it
* The air becomes unstable, causing it to expand and rise
* As the air rises, its temperature begins to drop
* When the rising air cools to dew point temperature, condensation occurs and cumulonimbus clouds are formed
* When the water droplets in the clouds become large and heavy enough, they fall to the ground as rain
* Convectional rain is often associated with lightning and thunder
* Generally lasts a short time, but brings intense rainfall over an area

#### Relief rain

* Relief rain occurs when warm moist air is forced to rise over landforms such as a mountain range
* Moist air passes over the sea and arrives at the coast
* The air is force to rise up the windward side of the mountain
* The air is forced to cool as it rises
* When the temperature of the air reaches dew point, condensation occurs and clouds form
* When the water droplets become large and heavy enough, they fall as rain on the windward side of he mountain where the air had risen up
* The other side of the mountain range, called the leeward side, is usually dry because most of the moisture would have fallen on the windward side

### Pressure and winds

#### Air pressure

* Air pressure is the force exerted on a unit area of the earth's surface by the weight of a column of air above it
* Measured in millibars (mb) using a barometer
* The average sea level value of air pressure is 1,013 mb
* It is considered high if it is above the sea level value, and low if its below the sea level value
* Decreases as altitude decreases
* Air is denser at lower altitudes because it tends to be more compressed at lower elevations, where the larger overlying mass exerts a larger gravitational force

#### Winds

* Air moves from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure
* This movement of air is known as **wind**
* Wind is described in terms of speed, direction and frequency
* Pressure gradient is the difference in air pressure between two locations
* The greater the difference in air pressure (steeper pressure gradient), the faster the wind speed
* Wind speed is the rate at which air is moving and is measured in kilometers per hour using an anemometer
* May be represented by the Beaufort Scale
* **Wind direction** refers to the direction from which the wind blows
* A wind vane is used to determine the wind direction. It points to the direction the wind is blowing from
* **Wind frequency** refers to the percentage to time the wind blows from a particular direction
* Winds that blow most frequently from a specific direction are called **prevailing winds**
* Wind direction and frequency can be recorded using wind roses
* The number of calm days without wind is stated in the circle in the wind rose
* The numbers represent the dates in a month in which the wind blew in a particular direction

#### Land breeze and Sea breeze

* Land and sea breezes are local winds that occur in coastal areas
* They lower the temperature of coastal areas and regulate the temperature during the night, leading to a smaller diurnal temperature range in these areas

**Land breeze**

* A land breeze is wind that blows from the land to the sea
* It is formed by differences in air pressure due to the different rate at which land and water bodies cool
* The land loses heat/ cools down faster than water bodies at night
* As a result, the sea has a higher temperature and lower air pressure than the land
* As air moves from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure, it forms a breeze that blows from the land to the sea at night

**Sea Breeze**

* A sea breeze is wind that blows from the sea to the land
* It is formed by differences in air pressure due to the different rate at which land and water bodies cool
* The land heats up faster than the sea during the day
* As a result, the land has a higher temperature and low air pressure than the sea
* As air moves from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure, it forms a breeze that blows from the sea to the land during the day

#### Monsoon winds

* **Monsoon winds** are regional wind patterns that reverse direction seasonally, bringing seasonal changes in precipitation
* The levels of precipitation can either increase or decrease with the occurrence of monsoons, and lead to wet or dry seasons
* Monsoon winds and other winds are affected by the Coriolis effect, which is a force produced by the earth's rotation
* As the earth rotates, the Coriolis effect causes the bending or deflection of winds

**Southwest Monsoon**

* The southwest monsoon takes place between June and September
* It is summer in the northern hemisphere, and winter in the southern hemisphere
* It is hot in the northern hemisphere, and cold in the southern hemisphere
* The air over central Asia heats up, expands and rises, forming a region of low pressure over the area
* The low temperature in Australia causes the air to be cold and dense, exerting a greater pressure on Australia
* Due to the difference in pressure between Central Asia and Australia, air moves from Australia to the Indian sub-continent and Central Asia as the **southeast monsoon winds**
* As the winds cross the Equator, the Coriolis effect deflect the winds to the right, becoming the southwest monsoon winds
* The winds warm up, and the warm air picks up moisture as it travels over the Indian Ocean and brings heavy rain to the Indian sub-continent
* Australia has dry and cold winds, with little rain

**Northeast Monsoon**

* The northeast monsoon takes place between October and February
* It is summer in the southern hemisphere, and winter in the northern hemisphere
* The air over Australia heats up, expands and rises, forming a region of low pressure over the area
* The low temperature over central Asia causes the air to be cold and dense, exerting a greater pressure on Central Asia
* Due to the difference in pressure between Central Asia and Australia, air moves from the Indian sub-continent and Central Asia to Australia as the **northeast monsoon winds**
* As the winds cross the Equator, the Coriolis effect deflects the winds to the left, becoming the northwest monsoon winds
* The winds warm up, and the warm air picks up moisture as it travels over the Indian Ocean and brings heavy rain to the Australian
* The Indian Subcontinent has dry and cold winds, with little rain

## Climatic types

### Equatorial climate

* Places that experience the equatorial climate are usually located between 10° north and south of the equator
* High temperatures due to high solar angle, concentrating the sun's rays at areas that experience the equatorial climate
* High mean annual temperature of about 27°C
* Small annual temperature range of 2°C
* High relative humidity of over 80% throughout the year
* Due to the high temperatures, water evaporates quickly into the air, forming clouds
* Convectional rain often occurs in the places
* High total annual rainfall of more than 2000 mm
* Rain generally falls throughout the year with not distinct wet or dry seasons

### Monsoon climate

* Places that experience the monsoon climate usually are located 5° and 25° north and south of the equator
* High mean annual temperatures, but lower than places that experience equatorial climate
* Places that experience the monsoon climate are located further away from the equator
* Concentrated rainfall in the summer (June-September for Indian-Sub Continent, October- February for Australia)
* Mean monthly temperature of 28°C just before the start of the wet season,but mean monthly temperature of 26°C once the wet season begins
* Small annual temperature range of 3-4°C
* Average rainfall of 2,000 mm of rainfall during the wet season, but average rainfall of 750 mm during dry seasons

### Cool temperate climate (Marine west coast climate)

* Places that experience a cool temperate climate are usually located near coastal areas found between 40° and 60° north and south of the equator
* Has the four distinct seasons of spring, summer, autumn, winter due to the tilt of the earth and its revolution around the sun
* Experience mild winters and cool summers
* During winter, these places had shorter days and recieve lesser energy from the sun
* They have a large annual temperature range of 21°C, between -3°C and 18°C
* Evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year
* Total annual rainfall is lower than those with equatorial or monsoon climate, ranging between 300mm to 900mm
* No distinct wet or dry seasons
