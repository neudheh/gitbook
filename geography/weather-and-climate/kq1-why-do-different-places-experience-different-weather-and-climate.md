# KQ1: Why do different places experience different weather and climate?

* Weather is the condition of the atmosphere at a particular place and time
* Climate is the average condition of the atmosphere of a specific place over a long period of time, usually over 30 years
* The weather can be describe in terms of 6 elements called the elements of weather, which are temperature, relative humidity, clouds, rainfall, air pressure and wind

## Temperature

* The degree of hotness or coldness of a place
* Measure in Degrees Celsius (°C) using a an analogue or digital thermometer
* A maximum and minimum thermometer is used to measure the maximum and minimum weather
* The mean daily temperature is the sum of hourly temperatures divided by 24 hours
* The diurnal temperature range is the difference between the maximum and daily temperatures recorded in a day, calculated by maximum daily temperature - Minimum daily temperature&#x20;
* The mean monthly temperature is the average of the daily temperatures  in a month
* The mean annual temperature is the average of the monthly temperatures recorded in a year
* The annual temperature range is the difference between the maximum and minimum mean monthly temperature recorded in a year

### Latitude

* Latitude is the distance of any point on the earth measured north or south from the equator
* THey are imaginary horizontal lines running from east to west around the earth and measured in degrees
* It is the most important factor affecting temperature
* The earth tilts at at 23.5° on its own axis, and as a result, the sun's rays strike at various angles at different parts of the earth
* The solar angle is which the sun's rays reach the earth; when the solar angle is higher, the sun's rays are more concentrated on the area
* Temperatures are lower at higher altitudes because the solar angle is lower, and the solar energy is spread out over a wider area, and the suns rays have to travel a longer distance
* More solar radiation is lost by reflection, scattering and absorption
* Temperatures are higher at lower altitudes because the solar angle is higher and heat from the sun is concentrated at a smaller area

### Altitude

* Altitudes is the height of a place in relation to the sea level
* Temperature generally decreases by 6.5°C with every 1,000m increase in altitude
* The atmosphere is mostly heated by the earth's surface
  * The sun's solar energy enters the atmosphere and reaches the earth in the form of shortwave radiation
  * About 45% of shortwave radiation is directly absorbed by the earth's surface, heating it up
  * The warm surface then emits heat in the form of longwave radiation
  * The higher up in the atmosphere you go, the further you are from the surface of the earth which is heated by the sun
* Longwave radiation that is emitted by the earth is absorbed by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
  * When the atmosphere absorbs longwave radiation the sun's solar energy is trapped and this warms the earth
  * Air that is nearer to the earth's surface absorbs more heat from longwave radiation than air at higher altitudes
* Air is less dense at higher altitudes
  * Dense air is able to absorb more heat from longwave radiation from the earth's surface, resulting in higher temperatures
  * The less dense air on top of a mountain has a lower ability to absorb heat than the denser air at sea level, resulting in lower temperatures

### Distance from the sea

* The sea heats up and cools down more slowly than the land, and the difference in the rate of heating and cooling of the sea and land affects the temperature of the coastal and inland areas
* The Maritime effect is the effect that large ocean bodies have on the climate of coastal areas, causing coastal areas to have a smaller annual temperature range
  * During summer, the air over the sea is cooler than the air over the land, as the land heats up quickly while the sea heats up slowly
  * The cooler air over the sea helps to lower the temperature of coastal areas, and therefore they are cooler than places further inland
  * During winter, the air over the sea remains warmer than the air over the land, as the sea cools more slowly than the land
  * The warmer air over the sea increases the temperatures of coastal areas, and therefore they are warmer than places further inland
* Due to the maritime effect, coastal areas experience cooler summers and warmer winters, and have a smaller annual temperature range than inland areas
* The continental effect is the effect continental surfaces have on the climate of inland areas, causing them to have larger annual temperature ranges
* As these areas are further away from the sea, the temperatures are not influence by the sea, and they experience warmer summers and colder winters, resulting in a large annual temperature range

### Cloud cover

* Cloud cover is the extent of the sky that is covered by clouds
* The amount of cloud cover influences the temperatures of the earth's surface in the day and at night
* More cloud cover results in a smaller difference between day and night temperature, resulting in a smaller diurnal temperature range
* During the day, clouds reflect a large portion of the sun's energy back to space, keeping the earth's surface cool
* They also absorb heat radiated from the earth's surface
* During the night, clouds absorb more of the heat that is radiated from the earth's surface and prevent is from escaping into space, keeping the air near the earth's surface warm at night
* During the day, the absence of clouds allow large amounts of the sun's energy to reach the earth, letting the earth's surface heat up quickly, causing the air near the earth's surface to be warmer
* During the night, the absence of clouds allows more of the heat radiated from the earth's surface to escape into space, and the air near the earth's surface is thus kept cooler at night

## Relative humidity

* Relative humidity is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) between the amount of water vapour present in the air and the maximum amount of water vapour the air could hold at a given temperature
* Measured using a sling psychrometer
* Saturation occurs when the relative humidity is at 100%
* The temperature at which saturation occurs is known as the dew point temperature
* Condensation is a process in which water vapour changes to a liquid form by cooling
* THe amount of water vapour in the air affects relative humidity, as the amount of water vapor in the air increases, relative humidity increases
* Temperature affects relative humidity as warmer air can hold more water vapour than cooler air
* When the temperature increases, the amount of water vapour stays the same, but air is able to hold more water vapor, causing relative humidity to decrease

## Clouds

* A cloud is a visible mass of water droplets or ice crystals that are suspended in the atmosphere from the condensation of water vapour
* The water droplets may eventually grow large enough to fall down to the earth's surface as precipitation

## Rainfall

* Precipitation refers to water in any form that falls from the atmosphere to the surface of the earth, including hail, snow , sleet and rain

### Convectional rain

* Convectional rain occurs when the earth's surface is heated intensely
* As the sun's energy heats up the earth's surface, the warm surface heats the air around ti, causing it become unstable, expand and rise
* As the air rises, its temperature starts to drop
* When the rising air is cooled to dew point temperature, condensation occurs and clouds are formed
* When the water droplets in the clouds become large and heavy enough, they fall down to the ground as rain
* It is associated with lightning and thunder
* It lasts only a short time, but brings intense rainfall over an area

### Relief rain

* Relief rain occurs when warm, moist air is forced to rise over landforms such as a mountain range
* Moist air passes over the sea and arrives at the coast
* The air then rises up the windward side of the mountain and is forced to cool
* When it cools to dew point temperature, condensation occurs and clouds form
* When the water droplets become large and heavy enough, they fall on the windward side of the mountain where air had risen up
* The leeward side , which is the other side of the mountain, is usually dry as most of the moistur has fallen on the windward side

## Wind and pressure

* Air pressure is the force exerted on an unit area of the earth's surface by the weight of an air column above it, and is measured in millibars (mb) using a barometer
* Air is denser at lower altitudes as it tends to be more compressed at lower elevations, where the larger overlying mass exerts a larger gravitational force, causing air pressure to be higher at sea level and lower at higher altitudes
* Air moves from an area of higher pressure to lower pressure in movements known as wind
* THe higher the difference in air pressure (Steeper air pressure), the faster the wind speed
* Wind speed is the rate at which air is moving and is measured in km/h, but may also be represented using the Beaufort scale
* Wind direction is the direction from which the wind blows, and a wind vane is used to determine wind direction as it points to the direction the wind is blowing from
* Wind frequency refers to the percentage of time the wind blows form a particular direction
* Prevailing winds are winds that blow most frequently from a specific direction
* Wind duration and frequency can be recorded using wind roses
* The numbers represents the dates in the month in which the wind blew in a particular direction, while the number in the circles is the number of calm days without wind

### Land and sea breeze

* Land and sea breezes are local winds that occur in coastal areas
* These winds lower the temperature of coastal areas during the day and regulate the the temperatures during the night, leading to a smaller diurnal temperature range
* A land breeze is wind that blows from the land to the sea, formed by differences in air pressure due to the different rates at which the land and the sea cool
  * At night, the land loses heat faster than the sea, causing the sea to have a higher temperature and lower air pressure than the land
  * As air moves from an area from higher pressure to lower pressure, it forms a land breeze which blows from the land to the sea at night
* A sea breeze is wind that blows from the sea to the land, formed by differences in air pressure due to the different rates at which the land and the sea cool
  * During the day, the land heats up faster than the sea, causing the land to have a higher temperature and lower air pressure than the land
  * As air moves from an area of higher pressure to lower pressure, it forms a sea breeze which blows from the sea to the land at night

### Monsoon winds

* Monsoon winds are regional wind patterns that change direction seasonally, bringing about changes in precipitation
* The Coriolis effect is a force produced by the earth's rotation, causing the monsoon winds to deflect

#### Southwest monsoon (June-Sep)

* During June to September, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere
* Air over central asia heats up, expands and rises, forming a region of lower pressure over the area
* Air over Australia is cold and dense, excreting a greater force on the earth's surface, causing an area of high pressure to form
* Due to the difference in pressure between central asia and Australia, air from Australia moves towards the Indian subcontinent as the southeast monsoon winds
* As they cross the equator, they are deflected to the right due to the coriolis effect, and become the southwest monsoon
* The warm air picks up moisture as it travels over the Indian ocean and brings heavy rain to the Indian subcontinent

#### Northeast monsoon (October- February)

* During October to February, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere
* Air over Australia heats up, expands and rises, forming a region of low pressure over Australia
* AIr over central asia is cold and dense, and exerts a greater force on the area, causing an area of high pressure to form
* Due to differences in pressure between Central asia and Australia, air over central asia travels towards Australia as the northwest monsoons
* As they cross the equator, the coriolis effect deflects the winds towards the left, and they become the northeast monsoon
* The warm air picks up moisture as it travels over the Indian ocean and brings heavy rain to Australia
