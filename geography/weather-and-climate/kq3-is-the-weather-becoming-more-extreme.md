# KQ3: Is the weather becoming more extreme?

## Characteristics of tropical cyclones

* Tropical cyclones are weather systems that develop over the warm oceans in the tropics

### Strong winds

* Have sustained wind speeds of 119 km/h or more because of the strong pressure gradient, resulting in strong winds spiralling inwards and upwards at high speed

### Low central pressure

* An area of low pressure is formed at the eye as warm, moist air over the ocean expands and rises
* As the warm air rises, condensation occurs and it releases latent heat, which is the heat energy released when water vapour condenses into water droplets
* The continuous large scale of latent heat warms the air, causing the air to expand and rise further, reducing the air pressure near the ocean surface, creating and sustaining an area low pressure in the entre of the cyclone
* As warm air rises,  it cools and sinks and the descending dry air creates an environment at the centre of the cyclone characterized by calmness and the absence of clouds, known as the eye

### Distribution

* Develop between the latitudes of 8-15° north and south of the equator but not close to the equator as the Coriolis effect is weak
* High ocean surface temperatures of above 26.5°C are necessary because the heat and moisture form ocean waters are required for it to form
* When tropical cyclones travel over land or cooler waters, they are not able to sustain their energy and will dissipate
* The presence of the Coriolis effect causes the air due to the pressure gradient to move at an angle instead of straight inwards to the cyclone, causing the rotatory effects of the cyclone

## Hazards associated with tropical cyclones

### Storm surges

* A storm surge is the sudden rise of the sea level in which water is piled up against a coastline beyond the normal conditions at high tide caused by a combination of low air pressure and strong winds
* When a tropical cyclone forms over warm ocean waters, the intense low pressure in the eye causes the sea level to rise, and strong winds push the water towards the coast, creating huge waves, giving rise to a storm surge
* Storm surges can destroy property and cause high death tolls
* May also result in vessels being swept in from the coast and standard inland
* Most of the damage to costal areas is caused by storm surges
* Example: In 2008, Hurricane Ike caused a storm surge of between 4-6m above the normal tide level in Texas, causing an estimated property damage of US$ 24.9 billion

### Strong winds

* The strong force of the winds that accompany tropical cyclones can damage or destroy infrastructure as well as injure people
* The winds can cause loose debris to fly and hit people and buildings
* Affects a larger area than storm surges
* Example: In 1992, Hurricane Andrew attained strong winds of up to 177km/h, causing widespread damage to the Bahamas and various parts of the US
  * Damage to infrastructure disrupted power supply and left about 150,000 homes without electricity

### Torrential rain

* Tropical cyclones produce large amount of rainfall that can result in inland flooding
* The sudden and large amount of rainfall also adds to the flow of water in rivers and streams and causes them to overflow
* Heavy rainfall may also destabilize slopes when there is too much water in the soil
* The excess water in the soil causes it to be unstable and may lead to a landslide that can entirely remove or crush buildings
* Places that are hundreds of kilometers far away from the coast may be affected by heavy rainfall for several days after the tropical cyclone has occurred
* Example: Hurricane Isabel flooded rivers that flow across the states of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Washington, D.C, affecting an area about 120 times the size of SIngapore, resulting in damages of more than US$2.23 billion

## Impacts of tropical cyclones

### Physical impacts

* The hazards associated with tropical cyclones can cause damage to infrastructure such as buildings, bridges and roads, and people are unable to live in their houses
* When bridges and roads are destroyed, it is difficult to transport food, clean water and medicine to the areas that need these items
* Communication networks are also disrupted
* Example: In 2009, Typhoon Ketsuna caused serious damage to the road networks in the Philippines, Cambodia and Laos, which hindered rescue work
  * 80% of the health centres in Manila, the capital of Philippines, was destroyed by the tropical cyclone, making it extremely difficult to distribute food and medicine to those who needed them

### Economic impacts

* The cost of repairs of damaged property and infrastructure caused by tropical cyclones can be expensive
* Example: In 2005, the damaged caused by Hurricane Katrina cost the USA an estimate US$81 billion, and a large portion of the cost came from the repairs of 200,000 homes
* Greater economic costs are also incurred from damaged crops
* Example: In 2011, Cyclone Yasi hit Australia about  75% of the total banana crop amounting to US$ 350 million was lost
  * 20% of sugarcane farmland was destroyed
* Food shortages can also occur due to destroyed crops and farmland
* Food aid is often provided to the victims of cyclones, where food and related assistance such as food assistance programmes and subsidies
* But, Flooded roads can make it difficult foe people living in affected areas to have access to food or food aid
* Example: In2008, when Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar a total of US$4 billion was required to repair the infrastructure of the country to provide humanitarian aid
* There is also a loss of income

### Social impacts

* Disruptions to the water supply, sanitation and hygiene facilities due to physical damage to infrastructure caused by cyclones, causing water pipes or pumps to be damaged, causing people in the affected areas to not be able to get fresh water
* Flooding caused by tropical cyclones may cause sewage form burst sewage pipes to flow into and contaminate existing supplies
* Consuming contaminated water can lead the spread of waterborne-diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever
* Example: In 2009, Cyclone Aila hit India, contaminating drinking water causing a cholera outbreak, infecting 1000 people and killing 14
* Flooding caused by a tropical cyclone may also lead to the spread of insect-borne diseases
* Example: Cases of dengue fever and malaria increase in Guatemala and Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch stuck in 1998

## Responses

### Emergency action

* Emergency action involves taking immediate action in response to any situation that poses risk to people's health and lives
* Governments can evacuate people to cyclone-proof places such as a community cyclone shelter before a tropical cyclone occurs
* Shelters are built with strong concrete which are raised above the ground and are able to withstand the hazards associated with tropical cyclones
* Community cyclone shelters are located near the homes of people
* The use of community cyclone shelters has greatly reduced the number of casualties because people have a safe place to evacuate to&#x20;
* Example: In Bangladesh, the presence of cyclone shelters helped reduce the casualty rates o cyclones like Cyclone Sidir
* The effectiveness of a community cyclone shelters is dependent on whether members of a community can get to it in time
* If a cyclone shelter is too far away, members of a community may not want to evacuate to it and may face a greater danger as a result
* Example: This is a problem in some rural communities in Bangladesh where the nearest community cyclone shelter can be in the next town away

### Prediction and warning

* By analysing long-term climate records, we can establish the pattern of occurrences and the severity of damage caused by past cyclones
* We can also use sensors, satellites, computer simulations as well as meteorological analysis to determine if an area is at risk of being hit by a cyclone, allowing for early cyclone warnings
* In Japan and the USA, this system is well-developed allowing people to have ample time to evacuate, reducing overall casualty rates
* Example: Residents of Florida were warned of Hurricane Irma 5 days before it made landfall in Florida, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate and saving many lives
* Hurricane predictions may not always be accurate as it is not possible to simulate events perfectly
* Computer modelling may not be reliable in predicting the path of a hurricane, and if the hurricane takes an unexpected path, it may lead to greater destruction than normal

### Land use control (floodplain mangaement)

* Land use control regulates the use of the land by placing restrictions on how land can be used
* It can take the form of floodplain or coastal plain management
* By having a masterplan that maps the land use of an area and implements evacuation routes based on it and measured to prevent floods, cities can reduce the potential of flood damage
* By ensuring that new developments on flood plains are not prone to floods, this can reduce the chance of potential damage caused
* Example: Cairns, Australia has a floodplain management plan that includes evacuation routes
* Land use control is only successful when authorities are able to enforce them
* Effective implementation of land use controls require much time and power
* Areas may have already been developed prior to the implementation of land use control, making its implementation tricker and more challenging

### Reducing vulnerability of infrastructure

* Infrastructure, if built to withstand tropical cyclones, should be resistant to water and wind damage
* There should also be regular inspection of river embankments and coastal dikes for breaches due to erosion
* Utilities should be moved underground to reduce the chance of damage by cyclone
* Buildings that are designed to be resistant to cyclones are less vulnerable to being damaged, leading to reduced rebuilding costs
* Galvanised steel hurricane ties can be used to reinforce roof to prevent them from being blown off
* Example: In Jensen beach, Florida, due to homeowners having cyclone resistant roofs, hurricane Wilma only cause minor damage to roofs in the area when it struck in 2005
* The implementation of such measures can be costly
* Protective barriers need to be regularly checked and repaired, resulting in high maintenance costs
* The relocation of utility lines underground may be costly as excavation is required to do so
