# KQ3: Is the weather becoming more extreme?

## Tropical cyclones

* Tropical cyclones are weather systems that develop over warm oceans in the tropics
* Diameter of 150-1500 km

### High wind speeds

* The atmospheric pressure just above the the warm oceanic surface in the cyclone is very low
* The steep pressure gradient results in strong winds spiralling inwards and upwards at high speeds
* Sustained wind speeds on 119 km/h
* The spiralling winds at the centre of the cyclone result in a column of sinking air known as the eye

### Low central pressure

* An area of low pressure is formed at the eye as warm, moist air over the ocean expands and rises
* As the warm air rises, condensation occurs and it releases latent heat
* Latent heat is the heat energy released when water vapour condenses into water droplets
* The continuous large-scale release of latent heat warms the air, causing it to expand and rise further
* This reduces the air pressure near the ocean surface, creating and sustaining an areas of low pressure in the centre of the cyclone
* As warm air rises, it cools and sinks
* The descending dry air creates an environment at the centre of the cyclone characterized by calmness adn the absence of clouds, known as the eye

### Conditions

* Tropical cyclones most often develop between 8-15° north and south of the equator, but not close to the equator
* High ocean surface temperatures of 26.5°C are necessary because the heat and moisture from the ocean waters are required for the tropical cyclone to form
* When tropical cyclone travel over land or cooler waters, they are not able to sustain their energy and will dissipate
* Under ideal conditions, tropical cyclones can last for weeks under favorable conditions
* The presence of the Coriolis effect is another condition needed for tropical cyclone to form
* The strong pressure gradient causes air to move inwards towards the cyclone
* Due to the Coriolis effect, it moves at an angle, beginning the rotatory movements of cyclones
* Cyclones do not form within 5° north and south of the equator due to the weak coriolis effect

## Hazards associated with tropical cyclones

### Storm surges

* A storm surge is the sudden rise of the sea level in which water is piled up against a coastline beyond the normal conditions at high tide
* Caused by a combination of low air pressure and strong winds
* When a tropical cyclone forms over warm ocean waters, the intense low pressure in the eye of the cyclone causes the sea level to rise
* Strong winds push the water towards the coast and creates huge waves, giving rise to a storm surge
* The greatest amount of damage to coastal areas is usually caused by storm surges
* Massive flooding can destroy property and cause high death tolls
* Vessels may also be swept in from the coast and stranded inland
* In **2008**, Hurricane **Ike** caused a storm surge between 4-6m above the normal tide levels in Texas, causing an estimated property damage of US$24.9 billion

### Strong winds

* The strong force of the winds that accompany tropical cyclones can cause damage or destroy infrastructure as well as injure people
* The winds can also cause loose debris to fly and hit people and buildings
* The impacts of strong winds affect a much larger area than storm surges
* In **1992**, Hurricane **Andrew** attained strong winds speeds of 177km/h causing widespread damage to the Bahamas and various parts of the USA
* Damage to infrastructure disrupted power supply and left about 150,000 home without electricity

### Torrential rain

* Tropical cyclones produce large amounts of rainfall that can result in inland flooding
* The sudden and large amount of rainfall also adds to the flow of waters in rivers and streams acd causes them to overflow
* Heavy rainfall may also destabilize slopes when there is too much water in the soil
* The excess water in the soil causes the soil to be unstable and may lead to a landslide, which can entirely remove or crush buildings
* In **2003**, Hurricane **Isabel** flooded rivers that flowed across the states of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Washington D.C. in the USA, affecting an area about 120 times the size of Singapore
* Resulted in damages of more than US$2.23 billion
* Although storm surges and strong winds mainly affect coastal areas, places that are hundreds of kilometers away from the coast may be affected by heavy rainfall for several days after the tropical cyclone has occurred

## Impacts

### Physical

* The hazards associated with tropical cyclones can cause damage to infrastructure such as buildings, bridges and roads, and people are unable to live in houses
* When bridges and roads are destroyed, it is difficult to transport food, clean water and medicine to the areas that need these items
* Communication networks are also disrupted
* In **2009**, Typhoon **Ketsana** caused serious damage to the road networks in Philippines, Cambodia and Loads, hindering rescue work
* 80% of the health centres in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, was destroyed by the tropical cyclone
* It became extremely difficult to distribute food and medicine to those who needed them

### Economic

* The economic impacts of tropical cyclones include the cost of repairs of damage property and infrastructure, and the loss of income due to damaged crops, which can amount to a large sum
* The damage to property and infrastructure caused by tropical cyclones can be expensive to repair
* In **2005**, Hurricane **Katrina** struck the east coast of the USA, costing US$81 billion, a large portion of which came from the repairs of more than 200,000 homes
* Great economic costs are also incurred from damaged crops
* In 2011, when Tropical Cyclone **Yasi** hit North Queensland, Australia in 2011, about 75% of the total banana crop amounting to US$350 million was lost
* The tropical cyclone destroyed about 20% of sugarcane farmland
* Food shortages can also occur die to destroyed crops and farmlands
* Food aid is often provided to the victims of cyclones, which is the provision of food and related assistance such as food assistance programmes and subsidies
* Flooded roads can make it people living in the affected areas to have access to food or food aid
* In **2008**, Cyclone **Nargis** struck Myanmar, and a total of US$4 billion was required to repair infrastructure of the country and provide food aid

### Social

* The social impacts of cyclones include disruption to the water supply and sanitation and hygiene facilities
* Physical damage to infrastructure caused by tropical cyclones could cause water pipes or pumps to be damaged, so people in the affected areas are not able to get fresh water
* Flooding caused by tropical cyclones may cause sewage from burst sewage pipes to flow into and contaminate existing water supplies
* The consumption of contaminated water leads to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever
* In **2009**, Cyclone **Aila** hit West Bengal, India, and contaminated drinking water caused a cholera outbreak resulting in about 1,000 infected people adn 14 deaths
* Flooding caused by a tropical cyclone may also result in the spread of diseases transmitted by insects
* In **1998**, Hurricane **Mitch** struck, causing cases of dengue fever and malaria to increase in Guatemala and Nicaragua
* The large-scale flooding and the fast rate at which diseases spread made it difficult to provide adequate medical care
* Displacement from their homes is another social impact
* In **2005**, Hurricane **Katrina** struck the USA, causing hundreds of thousands of epople to lose their homes

## Responses

### Emergency action

* To minimise injury and death where a tropical cyclone occurs, countries can take emergency action, which involves taking immediate action in response to any situation that poses risk to people's health and lives
* Governments may issue weather warnings and advisories to make preparations to protect lives and properties
* Governments can evacuate people to cyclone-proof places such as a community cyclone shelter before a tropical cyclone occurs
* Shelter build with strong concrete which are raised above the ground are able to withstand the hazards associated with tropical cyclones
* The use of community cyclone shelters has greatly reduced the number of casualties in countries such as Bangladesh and India
* Assistance from the national government and governments of neighbouring countries is often needed to help repair the damage caused by a tropical cyclone adn to provide aid to victims
* NGOs such as the Red Cross, Oxfam and Save the Children often organise and send relief teams to countries struck by cyclones
* They provide victims with basic necessities such as food, clothing, shelter and healthcare
* In **2010**, Typhoon **Megi** struck the Philippines, and the Red Cross provided 11,190 families with food packages, speeding mats, blankets, mosquito nets, hygiene kits and containers for water

### Mitigation measures

* Mitigation measures are strategies taken to reduce or avoid the impact of a hazard

#### Prediction and warning

* One method of predicting cyclones is analysing long-term climate records
* This method establishes the pattern of the occurrences and the severity of the damage caused by past cyclones
* By analysing this patten, it is possible to predict when cyclones of a similar severity occur
* But, climate records of past events only indicate the frequency of tropical cyclone, and do not give accurate details about when future tropical cyclones will occur
* Another prediction methods is computer modelling, which alloys for predictions to be made about the cyclone's path, as well as likely areas that will be affected and the degree of damage
* But, the predicted path of cyclones may not be completely accurate as they are based off weather information available at the time, and weather conditions may change quickly

#### Land use control

* Land use control regulations regulate the use of the land by placing restrictions on how it can be used, and can take the form of coastal plain management, or floodplain management
* Areas along the coast are vulnerable to storm surges and flooding caused by tropical cyclones
  * Developers may need to pay higher taxes to use the land along the coasts to discourage development in these vulnerable areas
  * The land along the coast can be used for recreational purposes instead such as parts
  * Protected zones where no development can take place can also be allocated
  * They serve as a barrier against storm surge of flooding, and ensure that no development are affected if the area becomes flooded or if a cliff collapses
  * But, it is only successful when the authorities are able to enforce them and they need much time and manpower
  * Developments such as buildings which are found along coastlines may have ben around for a long time, and residents may be reluctant to move out of these areas
  * The government needs to purchase the land in these areas to in order to convert them into recreational areas, and it may be very costly to do so
* A floodplain is a low lying area that is near rivers or the coast
  * Floodplain management refers to a master plan to reduce the potential of flood damage, which involves mapping the land use of the area and implementing measures to prevent floods
  * This is achieved by ensuring that new developments in floodplains are not prone to floods, and reducing the potential of flood damage in already developed floodplains
  * The master plan also includes the drawing up of evacuation plan to ensure that people are able to leave the flooded area as quickly as possible
  * Cairns, Australia has a floodplain management plan that includes evacuation routes

#### Reducing vulnerability of infrastructure

* In order to reduce the impacts of tropical cyclones, infrastructure needs to be able to withstand tropical cyclones
* Reducing the vulnerability of infrastructure includes designing buildings that are resistant to wind and water damage, regular inspection of river embankments and coastal dikes for breaches due to erosion, and locating utility lines underground
* Buildings can be designed to be resistant to wind and water damage during tropical cyclones
  * Galvanised steel hurricane ties are nailed to the roof to prevent it from being blown off by the strong winds of tropical cyclones
  * A layer of secondary water resistance is added to the roofs of houses to prevent leaking if the roof is blown off during a tropical cyclone
  * In Florida, USA, the state government aids homeowners by employing specialised companies to improve the design of the roof and the openings of the houses
  * Most of the houses of most citizens living on Jensen beach in Florida suffered only minor roof damage when Hurricane Wilma struck in 2005
* Protective barriers such as river embankments and coastal dikes need to be regularly inspected
  * River embankments are walls constructed by the sides of rivers to prevent a river from overflowing
  * Coastal dikes are artificial walls made of stone, often meant to prevent the flooding of coastal areas
  * Protective barriers to rivers and coasts need to be regularly inspected and reinforced as they are continuously eroded by river waters and coastal waves
  * Regular inspection and maintenance of protective barriers is costly as it involves repairing any damage on these barriers
  * The construction of a protective barrier along the coast in Apia, Samoa protected the coastline and harbour when Cyclone Val struck the island in 1991, leaving the harbour largely intact
* Utility lines such as power and telecommunication lines and water supply networks can be placed underground to avoid damage by strong winds and storm surges
  * This can ensure that services are maintained during and after a tropical cyclone
