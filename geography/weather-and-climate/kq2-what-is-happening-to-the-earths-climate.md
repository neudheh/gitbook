# KQ2: What is happening to the earth's climate?

## Climate change and global warming

* Global climate change refers to the variation in the global climate or climatic patterns in the long term, including major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns that occur over several decades or longer
* Since the 1800s, the earth has experienced a significant but irregular upward trend in temperature with fluctuations of 0.3 - 0.6°C
* This is due to global warming, the increase in global temperatures over a long period of time

## Natural causes of climate change

### Variations in solar output

* The sun emits varying amount of solar radiation due to changes in tis magnetic fields, which affects the earth climate as it is very sensitive to the amount of solar radiation it receives
* Sunspots are cooler regions on the sun's surface that appear as dark spots
* During periods of intense solar magnetic activity, the number of sunspots increases
* This results in higher solar radiation, as areas surrounding the sunspots radiate more energy to compensate for the lower temperatures of the sunspot areas
* Higher sunspot activity is linked to higher amounts of solar radiation emitted
* The number ro sunspots rises and falls with an approximate 11 year cycle, which is associated with the earth's cycle of high and low global temperatures
* A peak in the number of sunspots in 2000 coincided with high solar activity, causing global temperatures to rise during this period

### Volcanic eruptions

* When a volcano erupts, large volumes of carbon dioxide, water vapour, sulfur dioxide , dust and ash are released into the atmosphere
* Sulfur dioxide reacts with water to form sulfur-based particles in the atmosphere
* Together with dust and ash, these particles reflect solar energy back into space, resulting in a cooling influence on regional and global temperatures
* When Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991, the eruption released 17 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, formning sulfur-based particles that spread around the earth in 2 weeks
* They reflected solar energy back into space, and lowered temperature in the northern hemisphere by as much as 0.6°C
* But, there are very few long-term effects of volcanic eruption's on the earth's climate, because the temporary global cooling influence will cease once all the volcanic dust and ash settle
* Human activities since the mid 1980s had resulted in more than 100 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes&#x20;

## The greenhouse effect

* The greenhouse effect is a natural process by which greenhouse gasses trap heat in the atmosphere, keeping it warm to sustain life on earth
* The earth receives shortwave radiation in the form of visible light on the sun, which passes through the atmosphere
* Some of the shortwave radiation is reflected by the earth and the atmosphere
* Most of the shortwave radiation is absorbed by the earth's surface which heats up as a result, causing it to emit longwave radiation in the form of infrared radiation
* The longwave radiation is absorbed by the gasses in the earth's atmosphere
* Water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and halocarbons such as CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) are good absorbers of longwave radiation, and are known as greenhouse gasses
* They absorb longwave radiation and re-radiate it in all direction
* Some of it escapes into space, but most of it is absorbed by other gas molecules in the atmosphere or the surface of the earth
* The enhanced greenhouse effect is the increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures
* This is because human activity causes greenhouse gasses to be released at a far greater rate than that of natural emissions of greenhouse gasses

## Anthropogenic factors

### Deforestation

* Deforestation is the loss of forests due to the removal/ clearance of trees in forested areas
* Trees are felled for wood to make products such as paper and building material, or to clear the area for mining activities, grazing of animal, planting of crops and construction of infrastructure
* Forests absorb billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide every year via photosynthesis, thu they take in a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions
* With deforestation, there are fewer trees and other plants to absorb carbon dioxide, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere
* Carbon dioxide is also emitted during the process of deforestation and land clearance
* Soil is the largest sources of carbon in the world as carbon is accumulated through the decay of organic matter such as dead leaves and animals
* Deforestation exposes soil to sunlight, increasing the soil temperature and the rate of carbon oxidation in the soil
* Carbon oxidation is the process by which carbon in the soil reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce carbon dioxide, thus deforestation increases the rate at which carbon dioxide is released from the soil into the atmosphere
* Between 2000 and 2010, 52,000 km² of forest was lost every year, meaning that every day 142.6 km² of forest, equivalent to about 4.5 times the area of Jurong Island is lost

### Changing land use

* As the population increases, the demand for agricultural and industrial land also increases
* Land is converted to urban or built-up areas as more people choose to live in cities
* Land use changes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions as more fossil fuels are burnt to meet the energy demands of agriculture, industry and increasing urban population
* Fossil fuels are formed from dead organic matter that has decomposed over many millions of year, commonly in the forms of oil, coal and gas
* Due to their high carbon content, fossil fuels produce a large amount of carbon dioxide gas when burnt, contributing to the increase in greenhouse gasses
* Large consumers of fossil fuels include China, USA, Canada and the UK
* 80% of SIngapore electricity comes from fossil fuels
* The world's usage of fossil fuels has increases in recent years, and billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide gas are released into the atmosphere each year
* In 2010, global carbon emissions totalled 30.6 million tonnes, a 5.6% increase from 2019,
* This corresponds to an increase in global temperatures in 2010, one of the warmest years in the 21st century, a significant 0.6°C from the average temperature in the 20th entry

#### Agriculture

* Agriculture is the practise of cultivating land, producing crops and raising livestock, and it is the 3rd highest contributor of greenhouse gasses
* Tractors run on fossil fuels which release carbon dioxide
* The use of inorganic fertilizers increase the amount of nitrous oxide in the soil, as it stimulates microbes in the soil to convert nitrogen to nitrous oxide faster than normal
* Nitrous oxide is released when soil is ploughed or when rain flows through the soil
* Organic matter such as dead leaves and manure releases methane during decomposition, which is even more rapid in rice fields due to the high level of moisture in the soil
* Cattle farming contributes to carbon dioxide emission as cattle release methane as a waste gas
* Millions of tonnes of methane are released each year from cattle farming
* Every cow produces between 1,000-8,000 litres of emissions daily
* Methane from cows accounts for more than 30% of Argentina's total greenhouse emissions

#### Industries

* Industries refer to the production of goods and services within a country
* Secondary industries, which are industrial economic activities such as manufacturing, involve  the burning of fossil fuels that result in greenhouse gas emissions
* Greenhouse gasses are also released as byproducts when goods are produced
* The largest carbon dioxide emissions from industrial process are found in North and Central America, Europe and Asia
* In the past, most carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes were found in Europe, North and Central America because they were heavily involved in manufacturing activities
* But, in recent years, China and India are also contributing more to global carbon dioxide emissions due to their rapid industrialisation

#### Urbanisation

* Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing number of people live in urban areas such as cities or towns
* Large amounts of fossil fuels are burnt to provide energy for household activities in urban areas, such as heating, cooling, cooking and lighting
* The high concentration of cars, busses and other forms of transport in urban areas also contributes to the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted in these areas
* Constructing infrastructure and producing construction materials also releases greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere

## Impacts of climate change

### Sea level rise

* Sea level rise the increase in the mean height of the sea's surface between high tide and low tide relative to land
* Higher temperature cause the melting of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, and the resultant meltwater causes a rise in the sea level
* Higher temperatures in the atmosphere causes water in seas and oceans to expand, resulting in a rise in sea level
* Rising sea levels have a negative impact on where humans live
* Over 660 million people worldwide live in areas less than 10m above sea level
* Rising sea levels threaten low-lying areas and islands
* 2/3 of the world's largest cities located in coastal areas are also at risk due to rising sea levels
* 33% of coastal and wetland habitats in the next hundred years if sea levels continue to rise at the current rates, due to coastal erosion during storm surges and coastal floods
* Majuro Atoll in the Pacific ocean will lose 80% of its land if sea level rise by half a metre

### More frequent extreme weather events

* An extreme weather event is a severe and rare weather phenomenon that results in significant economic losses and the loss of lives
* One type of extreme weather event is the heat wave, which are 'silent killers', and can kill many people although they are neither destrictive nor violent
* When people are subject to extreme heat, vital organs are at risk and death results when the body cannot cool itself down sufficiently
* Young children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses
* The occurrence of extreme weather events has increased in the last few decades due to higher land and sea surface temperatures
* This results in greater amounts of water vapour and latent heat in a warmer atmosphere, making it a powerful driving force for extreme weather events
* In August 2003, Europe experienced a heatwave killing more than 70,000 people

### Spread of insect-borne infectious diseases

* Climate change could result in increased temperatures and rainfall in various parts of the world
* Insects thrive in these favourable conditions, leading to the spread of infectious insect-borne diseases, which are diseases transmitted to humans or animals by insects
* Heavy rainfall may allow mosquitoes to grow in numbers in aquatic habitats, resulting in the spread of malaria and dengue fever
* Malaria is an insect-borne disease spread by the mosquito parasite, which causes high fever, chills and flu-like symptoms
* Dengue fever is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito, with symptoms such as fever, headaches and severe bleeding
* Regions with moderate temperatures, such as Europe and North America, are facing diseases once confined to the tropics
* Dengue fever was reported in the cool climate areas of Nepal and Bhutan for the first time in 2004

### Lengthening of the growing season in certain regions

* Higher temperature may result in longer growing seasons in some regions
* The growing season refers to the periods during which crops can be grown
* Advantages
  * An increase in the type of crops that can be grown th the UK; new crops such as blackberries and maize can be cultivated
  * The production of fruit, soya beans and potatoes is projected to increase in Canada
* Disadvantages
  * In the Yunnan province, China, the productions of fruits such as apples and cherries, and nuts such as almonds and walnuts is reduced as these fruits and nuts require cool weather conditions
  * In Canada, the average wheat grain yield has reduced

## Responses

### International agreements (Kyoto Protocol)

* International agreements are contracts signed by two or more countries
* The Kyoto protocol is an agreement linked to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change)
* The UNFCCC is an international convention set up with the goal of reducing the levels of greenhouse gasses in the environment
* Under the protocol, various targets were set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were set for participating countries
* Greater responsibility to reduce emissions was placed on 37 developed countries and the european countries
* These countries were mainly responsible for the high levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere as a result of 150 years of industrial activities
* From 2008 to 2012, these countries were obligated to reduce their combined greenhouse gas emissions by at least 5% below their 1990 levels.
* Depending on the ability of each country, these countries had additional responsibilities such as helping less developed countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by providing them with funds
* Many countries have met or exceeded the targets set by the Kyoto Protocol
* France, Greece, Ireland met their emission reduction targets
* It was also successful in encouraging sustainable development
* The Clean Development Mechanism gave Certified Emission Reduction Credits to countries who carried out emission-reduction projects such as installing energy-efficient infrastructure in less developed countries
* Each credit is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide
* Although most countries managed to meet their emission targets, where were those like Denmark, Austria and Spain that did not achieve their targets
* It was not compulsory for countries with low greenhouse gas emissions to provide support to other countries, hence countries with high greenhouse gas emissions may not be able to easily achieve their targets
* Some of the largest contributors of Greenhouse gasses such as China, India and USA did not sign the agreement

### National responses

#### Singapore Green Plan 2012: Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using natural gas as an energy source

* Launched by the mInistry of the Venironment in 2002
* AImed to generate 60% of Singapore's energy needs using natural gas by 2012
* Natural gas is a cleaner form of energy in comparison to coal because it does not produce smoke
* As early as 2010, 79% of electricity was being generated from natural gas, exceeding the target ahead of schedule
* But, natural gas requires complex treatment plants to process adn pipelines to transport
* These pipelines have high maintenance costs as they need to be laid underground and checked regularly for leakage

#### Green Mark Scheme: Constructing 'green' buildings

* Launched by the Building Construction Authority (BCA) in 2005
* The scheme allows buildings to be evaluated and certified according to how energy-efficient and environmentally friendly they are
* The scheme aims to encourage more new 'green buildings' , which are more energy efficient
* Buildings which use less energy to provide the same service have greater energy efficiency
* Promotes energy conservation in the long run, which are efforts made to reduce energy consumption
* Existing 'green' buildings include Plaza by the Park, Standard Chartered @ Changi and the National Library Building have reported energy savings of 15% to 35% compared to conventional buildings
* This helps to reduce Greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity
* Construction companies and developers in Singapore tend to be conservative about adopting new ideas and materials to build 'green' buildings
* 'Green' buildings are built using processes that are environmentally-friendly adn resource-efficient
* Expensive to build as 'green' materials may be more expensive, such as bamboo or recycled metal that are non-toxic, res=usable, renewable or recyclable

#### Plant-A-Tree Programme: Planting more trees and plants

* Started in 1971 as tree planting day, the Plant-A-Tree Programme by the Garden City FUnd and SIngapore Environment Council aims to maintain Singapore's status as a Garden City by planting trees
* Residents are encouraged to donate money to buy a tree or take part in tree planting events that take place monthly throughout Singapore
* THe programme has contributed to an estimated 60,00 trees planted yearly throughout Singapore by NParks
* Trees are the green lungs of the environment as they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
* Trees take many years to mature, so the positive effects of tree planting will take time to materialise
* Even relatively fast-growing trees such as angsanas, raintrees, and yellow flames that were planted by NParks took 25 years to reach their full height
